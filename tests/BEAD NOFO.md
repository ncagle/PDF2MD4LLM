*See* Section V of this NOFO for detailed information concerning submission requirements.

**H. Funding Opportunity Description**

NTIA issues this NOFO to describe the requirements under which it will award grants for the
Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program (Program), authorized by the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Division F, Title I, Section 60102, Public Law
117-58, 135 Stat. 429 (November 15, 2021) (Infrastructure Act or Act) also known as the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BEAD Program provides new federal funding for NTIA to
grant to all fifty states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (States), as well as American
Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States Virgin
Islands (Territories), and in certain circumstances political subdivisions of these States and
Territories, for broadband planning, deployment, mapping, equity, and adoption activities.
Funding is distributed primarily based on the relative number of “unserved” locations ( *i.e.*,
broadband-serviceable locations that lack access to Reliable Broadband Service at speeds of at
least 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream and latency levels low enough to support realtime, interactive applications) in each State and Territory. Each State is eligible to receive a
minimum of $100,000,000 and each Territory is eligible to receive a minimum of $25,000,000.
*See* Section I of this NOFO for the full Program Description.

**I. Funding Instrument**

Grant.

**J. Eligibility**

Eligible Entities authorized to apply to NTIA for grants under the BEAD Program are the entities
identified in Section 60102(a)(2)(F) of the Infrastructure Act—specifically, any State of the
United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. *See* Section III of this NOFO
for additional information concerning the BEAD Program’s eligibility requirements.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 2

**K. Anticipated Amounts**

Each State is eligible to receive a minimum allocation of $100,000,000. Each State may request
up to $5,000,000 of its minimum allocation in Initial Planning Funds. American Samoa, Guam,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands each are
eligible to receive a minimum allocation of $25,000,000. Each of those territories may request up
to $1,250,000 of its minimum allocation in Initial Planning Funds. Not less than twenty percent
of the total allocation for a State or Territory will be made available at the approval of the Initial
Proposal with remaining funds released upon approval of the Final Proposal.

After the publication of broadband coverage maps being prepared by the Federal
Communications Commission (Broadband DATA Maps), which will be used to determine the
number of unserved locations in every State and Territory, NTIA will notify Eligible Entities of
their total funding allocations, calculated in accordance with Sections 60102(c)(1) and (c)(3) of
the Infrastructure Act, and inclusive of the minimum initial allocation and Initial Planning Funds.

*See* Section II of this NOFO for additional information pertaining to award amounts and to the
period of performance for grants issued pursuant to this NOFO.

**L. Cost Sharing/Matching**

Except in certain specific circumstances described herein (including projects in designated
“high-cost areas,” as defined in Section 60102(a)(2)(G), and other cases in which NTIA has
waived the matching requirement pursuant to Section 60102(h)(3)(A)(ii)), for each broadband
deployment project utilizing BEAD grant funding, each Eligible Entity shall provide, require its
subgrantee to provide, or provide in concert with its subgrantee, matching funds of not less than
25 percent of project costs. Funds from federal programs, including funds from the
Commission’s Universal Service Fund programs, generally may not be used as matching funds;
however, the Infrastructure Act expressly provides that matching funds for the BEAD Program
may come from a federal regional commission or authority and from funds that were provided to
an Eligible Entity or a subgrantee for the purpose of deploying broadband service under the
Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 116-127; 134 Stat. 178); the CARES Act
(Public Law 116-136; 134 Stat. 281), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law
116-260; 134 Stat. 1182); or the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2; 135
Stat. 4), to the extent permitted by those laws. *See* Section III.B of this NOFO for more
information pertaining to the cost sharing requirements for this Program.

**I.** **Program Description**

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) issues this Notice of
Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to describe the requirements under which it will award grants in
connection with the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program (Program),
authorized by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Division F, Title I, Section
60102, Public Law 117-58, 135 Stat. 429 (November 15, 2021) (Infrastructure Act or Act) also
known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The BEAD Program provides federal funding for
grants to Eligible Entities for broadband planning, deployment, mapping, equity, and adoption
activities.

**A.** **NOFO Structure**

This NOFO presents information relevant to entities eligible for direct receipt of BEAD funding
( *i.e.*, States and Territories, referred to in the Infrastructure Act as “Eligible Entities”), as well as
entities that may seek subgrants from those Eligible Entities to conduct the numerous activities
that are eligible uses for BEAD funding. It is generally organized as follows:

**Section I (Program Description)** provides an overview of the BEAD Program, including
background material related to the Infrastructure Act broadly, as well as an overview of the
Program’s procedural framework. It then defines key terms used throughout the NOFO.

**Section II (Federal Award Information)** provides basic information such as the amounts made
available under the BEAD Program, key dates, the circumstances in which the Assistant
Secretary may grant extensions, and the treatment of unallocated and unawarded funds.

**Section III (Eligibility Information)** describes entities eligible for BEAD Program grants
(generally, States and Territories of the United States), requirements relating to the provision of
matching funds by Eligible Entities and/or other actors, and circumstances that might warrant
waiver of the match requirements.

**Section IV (Program Sequencing, Structure, and Requirements)** provides information
regarding the BEAD Program’s structure, describing in detail the nine principal steps in the

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 5

process: (1) the Letter of Intent, (2) the Request for Initial Planning Funds, (3) the Five-Year
Action Plan, (4) Program Fund Allocation and the Notice of Available Amounts, (5) the Initial
Proposal, (6) the Challenge Process, (7) the Subgrantee Selection Process, (8) the 20 Percent
Funding Release, and (9) the Final Proposal and Release of Remaining Funds. NTIA urges
entities seeking to participate in the BEAD Program as Eligible Entities or as subgrantees to
review this section especially closely. NTIA plans to provide detailed technical assistance to
Eligible Entities regarding all matters addressed in this section.

**Section V (Application and Submission Information)** sets out information regarding how
Eligible Entities may apply for and use BEAD Program funding, including a link to the online
application portal, formatting instructions, certification requirements, submission timelines, and
eligible uses for funding. It also provides information regarding certifications that prospective
subgrantees must make in order to be eligible for subgrants.

**Section VI (Application Review Information)** briefly describes the review process that NTIA
will undertake in assessing submissions by Eligible Entities in connection with the BEAD
Program. [1]

**Section VII (Federal Award Administration Information)** explains the process NTIA will
employ to approve applications, notify successful and unsuccessful applicants of the process’s
results, and various legal obligations applicable to grant recipients (including, but not limited to,
those relating to domestic procurement preferences (“Buy American” requirements) and
contracting with small and minority businesses, women’s business enterprises, and labor surplus
area firms).

**Section VIII (Federal Awarding Agency Contacts)** provides contact information for
individuals to whom interested parties may direct inquiries regarding the BEAD Program.

**Section IX (Other Information)** details information regarding topics including audit and
reporting requirements, mandatory transparency, accountability, and oversight measures, and
consequences associated with the unauthorized use of BEAD Program funds.

**B.** **Overview**

**1.** **Background**

In recent decades, access to the internet has played a critical and growing role in the ways in
which Americans work, learn, receive health care, and participate in democracy. The COVID-19
pandemic crystalized what many have known for a very long time: High-speed internet access is
not a luxury, but a necessity, for all Americans, regardless of their age, race, or income,
irrespective of where they live, what languages they speak, what resources they have at their
disposal, and what specific challenges they may face in their daily lives.

Recognizing broadband’s fundamental role in today’s society and its centrality to our nation’s
continued health and prosperity, President Biden has pledged to make sure that every American

1 NIST is the entity within the Department of Commerce that will administer BEAD Program grants.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 6

has access to reliable, affordable, high-speed internet. Full participation in our twenty-first
century economy requires no less. Digital equity is necessary for civic and cultural participation,
employment, lifelong learning, and access to essential services. Yet affordable, reliable, highspeed internet access has remained elusive to many for too long, because they live in a location
where no service is available, the speed or quality of the service available is unreliable, or the
offering available is unaffordable or inadequate. Internet connectivity itself is a necessary, but
not sufficient, condition for eradicating the digital divide. Many on the wrong side of that divide
require equipment, digital skills, financial resources, and more to realize the internet’s full
potential. Those who lack these resources face substantial barriers to digital equity, even in
places where fast broadband connections are physically available. This digital divide is
particularly acute for communities of color, Tribal nations, and lower-income areas and spans
both urban and rural areas of the country.

Passed on a bipartisan basis, the Infrastructure Act includes $42.45 billion to create the BEAD
Program. The law charges NTIA—the President’s chief advisor on telecommunications and
information policy matters, housed within the United States Department of Commerce (DOC)—
with administering this program.

This NOFO describes how, in partnership with other federal actors, as well as States, Territories,
Tribal nations, cities, towns, counties and other localities, the non-profit sector, academia, unions
and worker organizations, and industry, NTIA intends to administer the BEAD Program. This
program will lay critical groundwork for widespread access, affordability, equity, and adoption
of broadband, create good-paying jobs; grow economic opportunities, including for local
workers, provide increased access to healthcare services, enrich educational experiences of
students, close long-standing equity gaps, and improve the overall quality of life across America.

The Program’s principal focus will be on deploying broadband service to *un* served locations
(those without any broadband service at all or with broadband service offering speeds below 25
megabits per second (Mbps) downstream/3 Mbps upstream) and *under* served locations (those
without broadband service offering speeds of 100 Mbps downstream/20 Mbps upstream).
Eligible Entities that demonstrate they will be able to ensure service to all unserved and
underserved locations will be free to propose plans that use remaining funds in a wide variety of
ways, but NTIA underscores its strong preference that Eligible Entities also ensure deployment
of gigabit connections to community anchor institutions such as libraries and community centers
that lack such connectivity. Eligible Entities can apply any additional funding to pursue eligible
access-, adoption-, and equity-related uses, as well as any other uses approved by the Assistant
Secretary that support the Program’s goals.

With respect to the deployment of last-mile broadband infrastructure, the Program prioritizes
projects designed to provide fiber connectivity directly to the end user. It also requires all
projects to provide a low-cost option to eligible subscribers, requires all states to have plans to
address middle-class affordability, and further prioritizes proposals that improve affordability to
ensure that networks built using taxpayer dollars are accessible to all Americans. The framework
set out below will provide Eligible Entities flexibility to pursue deployments in the manner best
suited to their populations – including, for example, the deployment of Wi-Fi service within
multi-family buildings.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 7

NTIA envisions and welcomes extensive coordination and cooperation with all relevant
stakeholders. States and Territories have an important statutory role in the BEAD process.
Localities and groups representing historically excluded communities can and must make their
voices heard to ensure that longstanding equity gaps are finally closed. Existing broadband
providers and new entrants must communicate well with Federal, State, Territorial, local, and
Tribal partners to ensure that deployments proceed as expected and that non-deployment
activities are designed and implemented in ways that most benefit the communities they are
designed to serve. And, of course, NTIA urges individual stakeholders to engage throughout the
process—with NTIA, with State, Territorial, and Tribal Governments, with providers, and with
civil society groups—to ensure that this historic investment effectuates the purposes of the
Infrastructure Act.

**2.** **Process Overview**

Successful execution of the BEAD Program will require close collaboration between NTIA, as
the Program administrator, and the Eligible Entities, which must ensure that affordable, reliable,
high-speed internet is accessible at every location within their jurisdictions and that other BEAD
Program objectives are achieved. Eligible Entities, in turn, can succeed only by committing to
close and ongoing coordination with their political subdivisions, subgrantees, and outside
stakeholders, including current and prospective broadband providers, citizens, civil rights- and
equity-focused organizations, community-based organizations, civil society and consumerfocused groups, unions and worker organizations, workforce boards, economic development
organizations, schools, community colleges, neighborhood and housing associations, and the
communities that stand to benefit from these unprecedented investments.

The Assistant Secretary and the staff of NTIA look forward to close communication during all
phases of the process described in this NOFO. Broadly speaking, the process contemplated by
the Infrastructure Act and this NOFO is as follows:

|Stage|Description|
|---|---|
|Letter of Intent|July 18, 2022 is the deadline for an Eligible Entity to submit a Letter of<br>Intent to participate in the Program.|
|Request for Initial<br>Planning Funds|Either with its Letter of Intent or afterwards, an Eligible Entity that is a<br>State (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) may request<br>up to $5,000,000 in Initial Planning Funds. American Samoa, Guam,<br>the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern<br>Mariana Islands each may request up to $1,250,000. Each Eligible<br>Entity’s Initial Planning Funds will be drawn from that Eligible<br>Entity’s Minimum Initial Allocation. If the Eligible Entity requests<br>Initial Planning Funds, it must submit an application for Initial<br>Planning Funds by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) August<br>15, 2022, and a Five-Year Action Plan within 270 days of receipt of<br>Initial Planning Funds.|



Notice of Funding Opportunity – 8

|Notice of Available<br>Amounts|On or after the date on which the Broadband DATA Maps are made<br>public, the Assistant Secretary will notify each Eligible Entity of the<br>estimated amount of funding that NTIA will make available to the<br>Eligible Entity under the Program (Notice of Available Amounts) and<br>invite the submission of an initial grant proposal (Initial Proposal) and<br>a final grant proposal (Final Proposal).|
|---|---|
|Technical<br>Assistance|Leading up to submission of the Initial Proposal and throughout the<br>remainder of the process, NTIA will provide support and technical<br>assistance to help ensure that the Eligible Entity’s proposals fully meet<br>the requirements of the Infrastructure Act and the goals of the Program.<br>This technical assistance will include iterative feedback on draft Initial<br>and Final Proposals.|
|Initial Proposal|Eligible Entities will have 180 days from receipt of the Notice of<br>Available Amounts to develop and submit an Initial Proposal, which<br>will, among other things, describe the competitive process the Eligible<br>Entity proposes to use to select subgrantees to construct broadband<br>projects. Prior to submission to NTIA, the Initial Proposal must be<br>made available for public comment, and the Initial Proposal must<br>incorporate local coordination feedback for the Assistant Secretary’s<br>review.|
|Challenge Process|After submission of its Initial Proposal and before allocating BEAD<br>funds received for the deployment of broadband networks to<br>subgrantees, an Eligible Entity must conduct a challenge process.<br>Under this process, a unit of local government, nonprofit organization,<br>or broadband service provider can challenge a determination made by<br>the Eligible Entity in the Initial Proposal as to whether a particular<br>location or community anchor institution within the jurisdiction of the<br>Eligible Entity is eligible for the grant funds, including whether a<br>particular location is unserved or underserved, and Eligible Entities<br>must submit any successful challenges to NTIA for review and<br>approval.|
|Initial Funding<br>Availability|NTIA will review Initial Proposals as expeditiously as possible. Once<br>an Initial Proposal is approved, NTIA will make available to the<br>Eligible Entity not less than 20 percent of the total grant funds<br>allocated to the Eligible Entity.|
|Subgrantee<br>Selection|An Eligible Entity may initiate its competitive subgrantee selection<br>process upon approval of its Initial Proposal and will have up to one<br>year to conduct additional local coordination, complete the selection<br>process, and submit a Final Proposal to NTIA. NTIA will provide<br>support and technical assistance to help ensure that the Final Proposal<br>fully meets the requirements of the Infrastructure Act and the goals of|


Notice of Funding Opportunity – 9

|Col1|the Program. The Eligible Entity may, at this point, utilize the funding<br>provided (not less than 20 percent of the Eligible Entity’s total grant<br>funds) to initiate certain eligible activities (see Section IV.B.8) before<br>submission and approval of their Final Proposals.|
|---|---|
|Final Proposal|After the Eligible Entity has selected subgrantees and otherwise<br>executed its approved Initial Proposal, it will submit to NTIA a Final<br>Proposal describing how it complied with that Initial Proposal and the<br>results of its processes. NTIA will award the remaining funds allocated<br>to the Eligible Entity upon approval of the Eligible Entity’s Final<br>Proposal, and Eligible Entities will initiate their subgrants for the<br>remaining 80 percent of funding and any portion of the original 20<br>percent that the Eligible Entity has not yet awarded as a subgrant. Prior<br>to submission to NTIA the Final Proposal must be made available for<br>public comment.|
|Ongoing<br>Monitoring,<br>Reporting, and<br>Performance<br>Management|Throughout the BEAD Program, NTIA will conduct ongoing<br>monitoring of an Eligible Entity’s progress against its plans and ensure<br>that the requirements of the Infrastructure Act are met. Eligible Entities<br>will be required to comply with reporting requirements and monitor<br>subgrantee compliance.|


NTIA strongly encourages each Eligible Entity participating in the BEAD Program to
concurrently participate in the programs established under the Digital Equity Act of 2021, which
provides $2.75 billion to further advance federal goals relating to digital equity and digital
inclusion. Just as the BEAD Program begins with a Five-Year Action Plan, the Digital Equity
Act begins with State Digital Equity Planning Grants, which is the subject of a separate NOFO.
Eligible Entities should view this NOFO and the State Digital Equity Planning Grant NOFO
holistically as complementary efforts aimed at a singular, unified objective of closing the digital
divide.

The Five-Year Action Plan that an Eligible Entity develops for the BEAD Program should
therefore incorporate the Eligible Entity’s State Digital Equity Plan, as an Eligible Entity cannot
have a Five-Year Action Plan that does not address digital equity. Moreover, Initial Proposals
and Final Proposals developed for the BEAD Program should be informed by and be
complementary to and closely integrated with the Eligible Entity’s Five-Year Action Plans and
State Digital Equity Plans to address the goal of universal broadband access and adoption. So too
each Eligible Entity should ensure overlap—or at least substantial interaction—between those
tasked with developing the Five-Year Action Plan, Initial Proposal, Final Proposal, and State
Digital Equity Plan. For example, Eligible Entities should ensure coordination between BEAD
planning teams and State Digital Equity planning teams and should establish a formal and direct
communication and collaboration pathway between the teams that remain in place throughout the
entire planning process. This will be particularly important to reduce the burden and confusion
on community stakeholders when fulfilling the local coordination requirements in this NOFO.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 10

NTIA is committed to working closely with, and providing support and technical assistance to,
Eligible Entities to help ensure that the Initial Proposals and Final Proposals fully meet the
requirements of the Infrastructure Act and the goals of the Program. NTIA will provide
submission templates throughout the process to provide clarity on expectations and reduce the
administrative burden on Eligible Entities. When the Final Proposals have been approved and
Eligible Entities begin to initiate Program activities, NTIA will work closely with the Eligible
Entities to monitor progress, troubleshoot, and provide technical assistance as necessary and
appropriate.

F) The household meets the eligibility criteria for a participating provider's existing lowincome internet program; or

G) The household satisfies any other additional criteria proposed by the Eligible Entity in
its Initial Proposal and Final Proposal and approved by the Assistant Secretary.

(k) Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold — an “Extremely High Cost Per Location
Threshold” is a BEAD subsidy cost per location to be utilized during the subgrantee selection
process described in Section IV.B.7 of this NOFO above which an Eligible Entity may decline to
select a proposal if use of an alternative technology meeting the BEAD Program’s technical
requirements would be less expensive. [6]

(l ) Funded Network —The term “Funded Network” means any broadband network deployed
and/or upgraded with BEAD Program funds.

(m) High - Cost Area —The term “high-cost area” means an unserved area in which the cost of
building out broadband service is higher, as compared with the average cost of building out
broadband service in unserved areas in the United States (as determined by the Assistant
Secretary, in consultation with the Commission), incorporating factors that include— (I) the
remote location of the area; (II) the lack of population density of the area; (III) the unique
topography of the area; (IV) a high rate of poverty in the area; or (V) any other factor identified
by the Assistant Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, that contributes to the higher
cost of deploying broadband service in the area. For purposes of defining “high-cost area,” the
term “unserved area” means an area in which not less than 80 percent of broadband-serviceable
locations are unserved locations. NTIA will release further information regarding the
identification of high-cost areas for purposes of BEAD funding allocations at a later date.

(n) Location; Broadband - Serviceable Location — The terms “location” and “broadband
serviceable location” mean “a business or residential location in the United States at which fixed
broadband Internet access service is, or can be, installed.” [7]

(o) Middle Mile Infrastructure — The term “middle mile infrastructure” (A) means any
broadband infrastructure that does not connect directly to an end-user location, including a

6 Each Eligible Entity must establish its Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold in a manner that
maximizes use of the best available technology while ensuring that the program can meet the
prioritization and scoring requirements set forth in Section IV.B.6.b of this NOFO. NTIA expects Eligible
Entities to set the Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold as high as possible to help ensure that
end-to-end fiber projects are deployed wherever feasible. NTIA looks forward to working with each
Eligible Entity to help develop an appropriate Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold.

7 Section 60102(a)(2)(H) states that the terms “location” and “broadband-serviceable location” “have the
meanings given those terms by the Commission under rules and guidance that are in effect, as of the date
of enactment of this Act.” *See* § 60102(a)(2)(H) of the Infrastructure Act. In the Third Broadband Data
Collection Report and Order, the Commission adopted “as the fundamental definition of a ‘location’ for
purposes of the [Broadband Serviceable Location] Fabric: a business or residential location in the United
States at which fixed broadband Internet access service is, or can be, installed.” *See* Establishing the
Digital Opportunity Data Collection; Modernizing the FCC Form 477 Data Program, WC Docket Nos.

an electric cooperative, nonprofit organization, public-private partnership, public or private
utility, public utility district, Tribal entity, or local government (including any unit, subdivision,
authority, or consortium of local governments) that provides or will provide broadband services.

(q) Open Access — The term “open access” refers to an arrangement in which the subgrantee
offers nondiscriminatory access to and use of its network on a wholesale basis to other providers
seeking to provide broadband service to end-user locations, at just and reasonable wholesale
rates for the useful life of the subsidized network assets. For this purpose, “just and reasonable
wholesale rates” means rates that include a discount from the provider’s retail rates reflecting the
costs that the subgrantee avoids by virtue of not providing retail service to the end user location
(including, for example, marketing, billing, and collection-related costs).

(r) Priority Broadband Project —The term “Priority Broadband Project” means a project that will
provision service via end-to-end fiber-optic facilities to each end-user premises. [9] An Eligible
Entity may disqualify any project that might otherwise qualify as a Priority Broadband Project
from Priority Broadband Project status, with the approval of the Assistant Secretary, on the basis
that the location surpasses the Eligible Entity’s Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold (as
described in Section IV.B.7 below), or for other valid reasons subject to approval by the
Assistant Secretary.

(s) Program —The term “Program” means the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment
Program.

(t) Project —The term “project” means an undertaking by a subgrantee to construct and deploy
infrastructure for the provision of broadband service. A “project” may constitute a single
unserved or underserved broadband-serviceable location, or a grouping of broadband-serviceable
locations in which not less than 80 percent of broadband-serviceable locations served by the
project are unserved locations or underserved locations.

8 NTIA adopts the definition of “middle mile infrastructure” set forth in Title IV of the Infrastructure Act,
modified slightly to reflect the term “community anchor institution” used in the BEAD Program. *See*
Infrastructure Act § 60401(a)(9).

9 A project that will rely entirely on fiber-optic technology to each end-user premises will ensure that the
network built by the project can easily scale speeds over time to meet the evolving connectivity needs of
households and businesses and support the deployment of 5G, successor wireless technologies, and other
advanced services. *See* Infrastructure Act § 60102(a)(2)(I). *See also* Section IV.B.7.b.i of this NOFO.

of— (i) an Indian reservation, pueblo, or rancheria; or (ii) a former reservation within Oklahoma;
(B) any land not located within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, pueblo, or rancheria, the
title to which is held— (i) in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian Tribe or an

10 The Infrastructure Act defines “reliable broadband service” as “broadband service that meets
performance criteria for service availability, adaptability to changing end-user requirements, length of
serviceable life, or other criteria, other than upload and download speeds, as determined by the Assistant
Secretary in coordination with the Commission.” *Id.* § 60102(a)(2)(L). For the purposes of this definition,
the Assistant Secretary adopts the criteria that Reliable Broadband Service must be (1) a fixed broadband
service that (2) is available with a high degree of certainty, (3) both at present and for the foreseeable
future, and finds, after coordination with the Commission, that the definition of Reliable Broadband
Service set forth in this NOFO best meets those criteria.

13 Broadband Data Collection Fixed Technology Code 10. *Id.* NTIA acknowledges concerns that, in some
cases, DSL arrangements fail to provide consistent access to advertised speeds. To the extent a particular
location is identified on the Broadband DATA Maps as served by DSL at speeds that warrant treatment of
that location as “served” or “underserved” but is not in fact reliably served at such speeds, this would be a
proper basis for challenging the relevant location’s service status during the challenge process created by
the Eligible Entity.

15 This NOFO generally uses the terms “subgrantee” and “subgrant” because these are the terms used in
the relevant Infrastructure Act provisions. We note, though, that applicable regulations governing federal
financial assistance generally use the term “subrecipient” to refer to what the Infrastructure Act calls
“subgrantees” and the term “subaward” to refer to what the Infrastructure Act calls “subgrants.” *See*
*generally* 2 C.F.R. Part 200. As used herein, the terms “subgrantee” and “subgrant” herein are meant to
have the same meaning, respectively, as the terms “subrecipient” and “subaward” in those regulations and
other governing authorities.

of the Department of the Interior that are near, adjacent, or contiguous to reservations where
financial assistance and social service programs are provided to Indians because of their status as
Indians; and the term.

(z) Tribal Government —The term “Tribal Government” means the governing body of any Indian
or Alaska Native Tribe, band, nation, pueblo, village, community, component band, or
component reservation, individually recognized (including parenthetically) in the list published
most recently as of the date of enactment of this Act pursuant to section 104 of the Federally
Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. § 5131). [16]

(aa) Underrepresented Communities —The term “underrepresented communities” refers to
groups that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of
economic, social, and civic life, including: low-income households, aging individuals,
incarcerated individuals, veterans, persons of color, Indigenous and Native American persons,
members of ethnic and religious minorities, women, LGBTQI+ persons, persons with
disabilities, persons with limited English proficiency, persons who live in rural areas, and
persons otherwise adversely affected by persistent poverty or inequality.

(bb) Underserved Location —The term “underserved location” means a broadband-serviceable
location that is (a) not an unserved location, and (b) that the Broadband DATA Maps show as
lacking access to Reliable Broadband Service offered with—(i) a speed of not less than 100
Mbps for downloads; and (ii) a speed of not less than 20 Mbps for uploads; and (iii) latency less
than or equal to 100 milliseconds. [17]

(cc) Underserved Service Project —The term “Underserved Service Project” means a project in
which not less than 80 percent of broadband-serviceable locations served by the project are
unserved locations or underserved locations. An “Underserved Service Project” may be as small
as a single underserved broadband-serviceable location.

17 The definitions of “unserved location” and “underserved location” set forth in Section 60102(a)(1)
require that a location have Reliable Broadband Service with “a latency sufficient to support real-time,
interactive applications.” *See* Infrastructure Act § 60102(a)(1)(A)(ii)(II), (C)(ii)(II). NTIA interprets this
to mean a latency of less than or equal to 100ms for the reasons articulated by the FCC’s Wireline
Communications Bureau in the 2013 Connect America Fund *Phase II Service Obligations Order* . *See*
*Connect America Fund*, WC Docket No. 10-90, Report and Order, 28 FCC Rcd 15060, 15068-76 paras.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 17

Eligible Entities may submit their Letters of Intent, Five-Year Action Plans, Initial Proposals,
and Final Proposals at any time during the windows established in this NOFO, and are
encouraged to file their submissions as soon as they are prepared to do so.

As established in Section 60102(h)(4)(C) of the Infrastructure Act, subgrantees that receive
BEAD Program funds for network deployment must deploy the planned broadband network and
begin providing services to each customer that desires broadband service within the project area
not later than four years after the date on which the subgrantee receives the subgrant from the
Eligible Entity.

**1.** **Extensions**

Extensions may be granted for both the Eligible Entity and subgrantees under the following
circumstances:

An Eligible Entity may extend the four-year network deployment deadline for subgrantees by not
more than one year if: (1) the subgrantee has a specific plan for use of the grant funds, with
project completion expected by a specific date not more than one year after the four-year
deadline; (2) the construction project is underway; or (3) extenuating circumstances require an
extension of time to allow the project to be completed.

Extensions for Eligible Entities for any part of the process may be granted at the sole discretion
of the Assistant Secretary when extenuating circumstances demonstrate that additional time will
support the overall goals of the BEAD Program.

**2.** **Petition for Extension**

Each Eligible Entity must develop a process by which subgrantees may request extensions and
provide documentation about the qualifying circumstance that warrants the extension.

If an Eligible Entity is seeking an extension for any part of the process with respect to which the
Infrastructure Act does not authorize the Eligible Entity itself to grant such extension, it shall
make a request in writing to NTIA and explain the need for such an extension. Such requests will
then be evaluated by the Assistant Secretary based on the text of the Infrastructure Act and the
goals of the BEAD Program.

**C.** **Award Amount**

States may request up to $5,000,000 in Initial Planning Funds. Further, each State is eligible to
receive a minimum initial allocation of $100,000,000 (inclusive of the Initial Planning Funds).
Territories may request up to $1,250,000 of in Initial Planning funds and are each eligible to
receive an initial minimum allocation of $25,000,000. Remaining funds will be allocated to
Eligible Entities based on the formulas provided in Section 60102(c)(1) and (c)(3) of the
Infrastructure Act.

NTIA will notify Eligible Entities of the funding allocations available to each Eligible Entity
according to the process described in Section IV.B.4.c.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 18

**D.** **Treatment of Unallocated and Unused Funds**

If an Eligible Entity fails to submit a covered application ( *i.e.*, a Letter of Intent, Initial Proposal,
or Final Proposal) by the applicable deadline or any subsequent resubmission deadlines if
revisions are needed, a political subdivision or consortium of political subdivisions of the
Eligible Entity may submit the applicable type of covered application in place of the Eligible
Entity. For more information on the ability of political subdivisions to apply in place of Eligible
Entities see Section IV.B.10 of this NOFO.

Subject to the application failure provisions set forth in Section IV.B.10, if an Eligible Entity
(including an Eligible Entity’s political subdivision or a consortium of such subdivisions) fails to
submit a covered application by the applicable deadline (including any deadlines for
resubmission if revisions are needed) and no extension is granted, the Assistant Secretary may
reallocate the amounts that would have been available to that Eligible Entity to the Eligible
Entities that did submit and receive approval by the applicable deadline. Such reallocation will
be based on the percentage of unserved locations in each Eligible Entity. If an Eligible Entity
fails to use the full allocation made to that Eligible Entity by the applicable deadline, the
Assistant Secretary may reallocate the unused amounts to other Eligible Entities with approved
Final Proposals based on the percentage of unserved locations in each Eligible Entity. The
number of unserved locations in each Eligible Entity for the purposes of such reallocations will
be made using the most recently published version of the Broadband DATA Maps available as of
the date the Assistant Secretary determines reallocation is appropriate.

**E.** **Type of Funding Instrument**

The funding instrument for awards made pursuant to this NOFO will be a grant.

**III.Eligibility Information**

This Section describes entities eligible for BEAD Program grants (generally, States and
Territories of the United States), requirements relating to the provision of matching funds by
Eligible Entities and/or other actors, and circumstances that might warrant waiver of the match
requirements.

**A.** **Eligible Applicants**

Eligible Entities authorized to apply for grants under the BEAD Program are any State of the
United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin
Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In cases of application failure,
an Eligible Entity’s political subdivision, or a consortium of such subdivisions, may seek to act
in the place of the Eligible Entity. For more information on the ability of political subdivisions to
apply in place of Eligible Entities see Section IV.B.10 of this NOFO.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 19

**B.** **Cost Sharing or Matching**

**1.** **Match Generally**

Except in certain specific circumstances described herein (including projects in designated
“high-cost areas” and other cases in which NTIA has waived the matching requirement), in the
context of subgrants used to fund broadband network infrastructure deployment, each Eligible
Entity shall provide, require its subgrantee to provide, or provide in concert with its subgrantee,
matching funds of not less than 25 percent of project costs. Funds from other Federal programs
(including funds from the Commission’s Universal Service Fund programs) generally may not be
used as matching funds; however, the Infrastructure Act expressly provides that matching funds
for the BEAD Program may come from a federal regional commission or authority and from
funds that were provided to an Eligible Entity or a subgrantee for the purpose of deploying
broadband service under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 116-127; 134
Stat. 178); the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136; 134 Stat. 281), the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260; 134 Stat. 1182); or the American Rescue Plan
Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-2; 135 Stat. 4), to the extent permitted by those laws.

Eligible Entities should rigorously explore ways to cover a project’s cost with contributions
outside of the BEAD program funding. Matching contributions, including in-kind contributions
that lower project costs, demonstrate commitment to a particular project and minimize BEAD
funding outlay, extend the reach of the BEAD program funding and help to ensure that every
unserved location and underserved location in the United States has access to reliable,
affordable, high-speed internet. In some cases, though, a match requirement could deter
participation in the BEAD Program by small and non-traditional providers, in marginalized or
low-income communities, or could threaten affordability ( *i.e.*, if an applicant seeks to offset the
cost of a substantial match through higher end user prices). In those cases, an Eligible Entity
should consider ways to cover part or all of the provider’s match through Eligible Entity or other
funds or seek a match waiver through the process explained below.

A matching contribution may be provided by the subgrantee, an Eligible Entity, a unit of local
government, a utility company, a cooperative, a nonprofit or philanthropic organization, a forprofit company, regional planning or governmental organization, a federal regional commission
or authority, or any combination thereof. As detailed in Section III.B.5, an Eligible Entity may
seek, and the Assistant Secretary may grant, a partial or full waiver of the non-federal match
requirement where warranted.

**2.** **Preference for Maximum Subgrantee Contribution and Minimal**
**BEAD Subsidy**

While the match may be provided by multiple sources, Eligible Entities are encouraged to
require a match from the subgrantee rather than utilizing other sources where it deems the
subgrantee capable of providing matching funds. [20] This approach will maximize the impact of

20 Rather than using State, Territorial, or local funds as a match to BEAD projects, Eligible Entities are
encouraged to use these funding sources on broadband separately and leverage additional subgrantee
match commitments. Eligible Entities also must use BEAD Program funds to supplement, and not

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 20

Eligible Entity funds and funds provided via other federal programs. As detailed below with
regard to the subgrantee selection process for last-mile broadband deployment projects, Eligible
Entities are also required to incentivize matches of greater than 25 percent from subgrantees
wherever feasible (especially where expected operational costs and revenues are likely to justify
greater investment by the subgrantee) by focusing on minimizing the BEAD funding outlay on a
particular project, to the extent consistent with other programmatic goals described in this
NOFO. [21]

NTIA will provide technical assistance to Eligible Entities to assist in making these
determinations. Eligible Entities will be expected to explain in their Initial Proposals how they
intend to ensure that subgrantees will offer the maximum feasible match for each project. [22]

**3.** **Matches from Other Federal Programs and Entities**

Except as expressly provided for in the Infrastructure Act, funds from other Federal programs
(including funds from the Commission’s Universal Service Fund programs) may not be used as
matching funds. The Infrastructure Act expressly provides that matching funds for the BEAD
Program may come from a federal regional commission or authority and from funds that were
provided to an Eligible Entity or a subgrantee for the purpose of deploying broadband service
under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 116-127; 134 Stat. 178); the
CARES Act (Public Law 116-136; 134 Stat. 281), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021
(Public Law 116-260; 134 Stat. 1182); or the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law
117-2; 135 Stat. 4), to the extent permitted by those laws. Eligible Entities are encouraged to
consider terms and conditions that may be associated with potential sources of match funds and
how those may impact the project overall. For example, if an Eligible Entity utilizes federal
regional commission funding as a match, the project will need to comply with all BEAD
programmatic requirements and any requirements imposed by the federal regional commission.
Likewise, Eligible Entities that use funds from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery
Funds or Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund as the source of matching funds for the BEAD
Program must comply with the requirements of both the BEAD Program and the relevant
Treasury program. Loan funding issued through a federal agency, such as through the USDA
ReConnect Program, may also be used as match funding.

**4.** **In-Kind Matches**

Matching funds may be provided in the form of either cash or in-kind contributions, so long as
such contributions are made consistent with the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost

supplant, the amounts that the Eligible Entity would otherwise make available for the purposes for which
the grant funds may be used.

21 *See supra* Section IV.B.7. If the Eligible Entity is considering competing proposals that are materially
identical, and one includes a higher proposed total cost but a larger match, whereas the other includes a
lower proposed total cost and smaller match, the key consideration for comparative purposes is the
amount of the subsidy required, not the proportion of the stated cost that the prospective subgrantee is
willing to match.

22 *See supra* Section IV.B.7.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 21

Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards set forth at 2 C.F.R. Part 200. [23] In-kind
contributions, which may include third-party in-kind contributions, are non-cash donations of
property, goods or services, which benefit a federally assisted project, and which may count
toward satisfying the non-federal matching requirement of a project’s total budgeted costs when
such contributions meet certain criteria. [24] In-kind contributions must be allowable and allocable
project expenses. The rules governing allowable in-kind contributions are detailed and
encompass a wide range of properties and services. NTIA encourages applicants to thoroughly
consider potential sources of in-kind contributions that, depending on the particular property or
service and the applicable federal cost principles, could include employee or volunteer services;
equipment; supplies; indirect costs; computer hardware and software; and use of facilities. In the
broadband context this could include, consistent with federal cost principles, waiver of fees
associated with access to rights of way, pole attachments, conduits, easements, or access to other
types of infrastructure.

**5.** **Match Waivers**

In evaluating requests for waiver of the BEAD Program’s non-federal match requirement, NTIA
will carefully balance the Program’s various objectives. It is NTIA’s policy to ensure that BEAD
funds are used to bring affordable broadband to all Americans. Thus, the Assistant Secretary will
generally seek to minimize the BEAD funding outlay on a particular project to extend the
Program’s reach, and expects to grant waivers only in special circumstances, when waiver is
necessary to advance objectives that are critical to the Program’s success. In order to be
considered for a waiver, an Eligible Entity must submit a request that describes the special
circumstances underlying the request and explain how a waiver would serve the public interest
and effectuate the purposes of the BEAD Program. The Assistant Secretary retains the discretion
to waive any amount of the match, including up to the full 25 percent requirement.

**IV.** **Program Structure, Sequencing and Requirements**

This Section provides information regarding the BEAD Program’s structure, describing in detail
the nine principal steps in the process: (1) the Letter of Intent, (2) the Request for Initial Planning
Funds, (3) the Five-Year Action Plan, (4) Program Fund Allocation and the Notice of Available
Amounts, (5) the Initial Proposal, (6) the Challenge Process, (7) the Subgrantee Selection
Process, (8) the 20 Percent Funding Release, and (9) the Final Proposal and Release of
Remaining Funds. NTIA urges entities seeking to participate in the BEAD Program as Eligible
Entities or as subgrantees to review this section especially closely. NTIA plans to provide
detailed technical assistance to Eligible Entities regarding all matters addressed in this section.

**A.** **Program Structure**

As described in greater detail below, the BEAD Program involves multiple steps and stages of
application review, a robust and competitive subgrantee selection process, and ongoing reporting
and monitoring obligations. NTIA will provide robust technical assistance throughout the
Program’s application, implementation, and reporting processes. NTIA intends to collaborate

23 *See id.* and 2 C.F.R. § 200.306.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 22

with Eligible Entities to maximize the effectiveness of allotted funding and ensure compliance
with all federal requirements, while allowing Eligible Entities to tailor program design to the
unique needs within their boundaries. Eligible Entities are encouraged to utilize resources that
will be made available by NTIA or other partner organizations and should reach out to Program
contacts whenever additional assistance is needed. Achieving programmatic goals will require a
partnership and ongoing dialogue between NTIA and Eligible Entities.

**B.** **Program Sequencing**

As set forth in the Infrastructure Act and outlined in greater detail below, the BEAD Program is
sequenced as follows:

1. Letter of Intent
2. Request for Initial Planning Funds
3. Five-Year Action Plan
4. Program Fund Allocation and Notice of Available Amounts
5. Initial Proposal
6. Challenge Process
7. Subgrantee Selection Process
8. 20 Percent Funding Release
9. Final Proposal and Release of Remaining Funds

The BEAD Program sequencing set forth in this Section contemplates that Eligible Entity
submissions and NTIA review will occur on a rolling basis. The deadlines set forth below are the
maximum amount of time allowed for each step in the process, absent an extension ( *see* Section

of existing resources that are currently available, which will include NTIA slide decks, program
and issue overviews, NTIA points of contact and where appropriate, share outside resources that
may be able to assist Eligible Entities. Eligible Entities are strongly encouraged to utilize free
resources provided by NTIA and other partners and are discouraged from using Initial Planning
Funds for resources that can be accessed by the Eligible Entity for free. An NTIA Infrastructure
Act website will have resources that are available to Eligible Entities. NTIA will have a robust
technical assistance program that will continually share updated resources to Eligible Entities.

**3.** **Five-Year Action Plan**

An Eligible Entity that receives Initial Planning Funds must submit to the Assistant Secretary a
Five-Year Action Plan that establishes the State or Territory’s broadband goals and priorities and
serves as a comprehensive needs assessment that will inform the State or Territory’s Initial
Proposal.

The Five-Year Action Plan developed using Initial Planning Funds must (a) be informed by
collaboration with local, regional, and Tribal (as applicable) entities, as well as unions and
worker organizations, (b) detail the Eligible Entity’s investment priorities and associated costs,
and (c) align the State or Territory’s planned spending with its economic development,
community benefit, workforce, telehealth, digital equity, and other related efforts.

27 Lobbying costs and contingency fees are not reimbursable from grant funds. Pre-award expenses should
be clearly identified in the proposed budget. Additionally, pre-award costs are incurred at the sole risk of
the applicant and will not be reimbursed by NTIA if the proposed project or other eligible activity does
not receive an award pursuant to this Program. Pre-award expenses must be approved by NTIA and the
Grants Officer in writing to be considered allowable;
28 Requests for approval of uses not listed here should be made in writing to the Assistant Secretary and
submitted through the appropriate Federal Program Officer. Eligible Entities should make such requests
on a timely basis to facilitate resolution prior to the point at which the Eligible Entity seeks to make the
expenditure or expenditures at issue.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 25

NTIA urges each Eligible Entity to apply for Initial Planning Funds and develop a Five-Year
Action Plan to ensure that it has comprehensively evaluated the broadband needs of its
communities and notes that much of the information required for the Five-Year Action Plan also
will be required in the Initial Proposal. NTIA expects to offer technical assistance with regard to
the Five-Year Action Plan and to provide specific feedback in response to each plan submitted,
which can facilitate later steps in the BEAD Program’s process.

**a.** **Five-Year Action Plan Timing**

A completed Five-Year Action Plan must be submitted to NTIA within 270 days of receipt of
Initial Planning Funds. The Assistant Secretary reserves the right to extend this deadline;
however, the Assistant Secretary will be reluctant to grant a waiver except in extraordinary
circumstances.

**b.** **Five-Year Action Plan Form and Content**

Preparing a Five-Year Action Plan gives Eligible Entities the opportunity to identify their
communities’ broadband access, affordability, equity and adoption needs and to adopt strategies,
goals and initial measures for meeting those needs using BEAD and other funds. At a minimum,
an Eligible Entity’s Five-Year Action Plan must:

1. Provide details of the existing broadband program or office within the Eligible Entity,
including any activities that the program or office currently conducts, any previous entitywide plans or goals for availability of broadband, and any prior experience awarding
broadband deployment grants.

2. Identify the funding that the Eligible Entity currently has available for broadband
deployment and other broadband-related activities, including data collection and local
planning, and the sources of that funding, including whether the funds are from the Eligible

BEAD Program and the Eligible Entity’s corresponding plans to address them.

6. Include an asset inventory that catalogues broadband adoption, affordability, equity,
access, and deployment activities occurring within the Eligible Entity and identifies and
provides details regarding any relevant partners, such as community-based organizations and
CAIs that may inform broadband deployment and adoption planning.

7. Include a description of the Eligible Entity’s external engagement process, demonstrating
collaboration with local, regional, and Tribal (as applicable) entities (governmental and nongovernmental) and reflective of the local coordination requirements outlined herein,

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 26

including outreach to underrepresented communities and unions and worker organizations.
The engagement required must be undertaken both during the development of the Five-Year
Action Plan itself and following submission of the plan, reflecting ongoing collaboration
throughout the BEAD Program.

8. Incorporate available federal, Eligible Entity, or local broadband availability and adoption
data, including but not limited to Affordable Connectivity Program enrollment data. Other
federal broadband federal data sources include the NTIA Internet Use Survey, [29] the NTIA
Indicators of Broadband Need Map, [30] and the American Community Survey. [31]

9. Identify local and regional broadband service needs and gaps within the Eligible Entity’s
boundaries, including unserved or underserved locations and CAIs without gigabit service,
and/or any plans to make these determinations where service availability is unclear.

10. Provide a comprehensive, high-level plan for providing reliable, affordable, high-speed
internet service throughout the Eligible Entity, including:

a. The estimated timeline and cost for universal service,

b. The planned utilization of federal, Eligible Entity, and local funding sources,

workforce needed to achieve the plan’s goals, including describing the involvement
and partnerships of sub-grantees, contractors, and sub-contractors with existing inhouse skills training programs, unions and worker organizations; community colleges
and public school districts; supportive services providers; Registered Apprenticeship
programs and other labor-management training programs, or other quality workforce
training providers.

11. Identify digital equity and inclusion needs, goals, and implementation strategies,
including ways in which the Eligible Entity plans to utilize BEAD funding, Digital Equity
Act funding and/or other funding streams in concert to remedy inequities and barriers to
inclusion. Accordingly, the Five-Year Action Plan should set forth a vision for digital equity,
include the results of a needs assessment for underrepresented communities and an asset
inventory of ongoing digital equity activities, and detail holistic strategies around
affordability, devices, digital skills, technical support, and digital navigation. This
requirement may be satisfied by the completion of a State Digital Equity Plan under the

implementation of the BEAD Program.

The Assistant Secretary will publish at [www.grants.ntia.gov](http://www.grants.ntia.gov/) an online template for submission of
the Five-Year Action Plan. Use of this template is optional. To the extent an Eligible Entity has
an existing plan that meets the requirements set forth above and has been completed in the last
12 months from the date of receipt of Initial Planning Funds, it may submit that plan as its FiveYear Action Plan. If an Eligible Entity has an existing plan that meets the requirements set forth
above in part, it may submit that plan as part of the Five-Year Action Plan, along with
supplemental materials sufficient to fulfill all of the requirements set forth above. However, with
regard to the statements above, please note that an Eligible Entity may not use BEAD funds to
pay for previously incurred costs (subject to limited exceptions described in Section IV.B.2 of
this NOFO). If an Eligible Entity does not utilize the online template published by NTIA, the
Eligible Entity must also provide an index, crosswalk, or similar document to allow the reader to
quickly and efficiently locate relevant content.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 28

**b.** **Form and Content of Notice of Available Amounts**

On or after the date on which the Broadband DATA Maps are made public, the Assistant
Secretary, in coordination with the Commission, shall issue a notice to each Eligible Entity that
contains the estimated amount of Program funds that will be available to the Eligible Entity
pursuant to the funding allocation process described below (the Eligible Entity’s “Total
Allocation”).

This “Notice of Available Amounts” will invite the Eligible Entity to submit an Initial Proposal
and Final Proposal in accordance with Sections IV.B.5 and IV.B.9 below.

**c.** **Funding Allocation Process**

The Assistant Secretary will, in coordination with the Commission, choose a date certain upon
which the Broadband DATA Maps will be utilized to identify unserved locations (the
“Allocation Date”). Each Eligible Entity’s Total Allocation will be the sum of the Eligible
Entity’s (i) Minimum Initial Allocation; (ii) High-Cost Allocation; and (iii) Remaining Funds
Allocation, each calculated as follows:

**i.** **Minimum Initial Allocation**

The “Minimum Initial Allocation” for (i) each State of the United States, the District of
Columbia, and Puerto Rico is $100,000,000, and (ii) for American Samoa, Guam, the U.S.
Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is $25,000,000.

**ii.** **High-Cost Allocation**

The “High-Cost Allocation” for each Eligible Entity will be calculated by (i) dividing the
number of unserved locations in high-cost areas in the Eligible Entity by the total number of
unserved locations in high-cost areas in the United States and (ii) multiplying the quotient
obtained by $4.245 billion.

NTIA will provide further information regarding its designation of high-cost areas in future
guidance and/or related documents.

**iii.** **Remaining Funds Allocation**

The funds remaining after subtracting each of (i) the total Minimum Initial Allocations; and (ii)
the total High-Cost Allocation from $41,601,000,000 are the “Remaining Funds.” [37]

Each Eligible Entity’s Remaining Funds Allocation shall be computed by dividing the number of
unserved locations in the Eligible Entity by the total number of unserved locations in the United
States and multiplying the result by the Remaining Funds.

37 This figure reflects the $42,450,000,000 appropriated for the BEAD program minus the two percent of
that sum allocated for administrative purposes. *See* Infrastructure Act § 60102(d); Section II.A of this
NOFO.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 29

**5.** **Initial Proposal**

The Initial Proposal is the “first draft” of an Eligible Entity’s Final Proposal for grant funding,
and, among other things, should explain (as described below) how the Eligible Entity intends to
ensure that every resident has access to a reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband connection,
utilizing all funding available to be brought to bear to accomplish this goal, including but not
limited to BEAD Program funds.

**a.** **Initial Proposal Timing**

On the date that an Eligible Entity’s Notice of Available Amounts is issued, the Assistant
Secretary will invite each Eligible Entity to submit an Initial Proposal. Each Eligible Entity will
have 180 days to submit its Initial Proposal but Eligible Entities are encouraged to submit Initial
Proposals earlier, if possible. Eligible Entities should not wait until the Notice of Available
Amounts is issued to begin preparing their Initial Proposals. Rather, they should begin this
process immediately upon receiving the online template. If an Eligible Entity fails to submit an
Initial Proposal by the deadline, this will be treated as an application failure by the Eligible
Entity pursuant to Section IV.B.10 of this NOFO. The Assistant Secretary reserves the right to
extend this deadline; however, the Assistant Secretary will be reluctant to grant a waiver except
in extraordinary circumstances.

**b.** **Form and Content of Initial Proposal**

NTIA will provide Eligible Entities with an online template for submission of the Initial
Proposal. An Eligible Entity may submit only a single Initial Proposal. [38]

The Initial Proposal must, at a minimum:

1. Outline long-term objectives for deploying broadband, closing the digital divide,
addressing access, affordability, equity, and adoption issues, and enhancing economic growth
and job creation including information developed by the Eligible Entity as part of the FiveYear Action Plan and information from any comparable strategic plan otherwise developed
by the Eligible Entity, if applicable. [39]

2. Identify, and outline steps to support, local, Tribal, and regional broadband planning
processes or ongoing efforts to deploy broadband or close the digital divide and describe
coordination with local and Tribal Governments, along with local, Tribal, and regional
broadband planning processes. [40]

38 Leading up to submission of the Initial Proposal and through the review and approval process, NTIA
will provide support and technical assistance to help ensure that the proposal fully meets the requirements
of the statute and the goals of the Program, up to and including iterative feedback on draft Initial
Proposals.

39 For States and Territories that have completed Five-Year Action Plans, reference to this plan satisfies
this requirement.

40 For States and Territories that have completed Five-Year Action Plans, reference to this plan satisfies

jurisdiction of the Eligible Entity to deploy broadband and close the digital divide, including
in Tribal Lands. [41]

4. Certify that the Eligible Entity has conducted coordination, including with Tribal
Governments, local community organizations, unions and worker organizations, and other
groups, consistent with the requirements set forth in Section IV.C.1.c of this NOFO, describe
the coordination conducted, summarize the impact such coordination had on the content of
the Initial Proposal, detail ongoing coordination efforts, and set forth the plan for how the
Eligible Entity will fulfill the coordination requirements associated with its Final Proposal.

5. Identify each unserved location and underserved location under the jurisdiction of the
Eligible Entity, including unserved and underserved locations in applicable Tribal Lands,
using the most recently published Broadband DATA Maps as of the date of submission of
the Initial Proposal, and identify the date of publication of the Broadband DATA Maps used
for such identification.

6. Describe how the Eligible Entity applied the statutory definition of the term “community
anchor institution,” identified all eligible CAIs in its jurisdiction, identified all eligible CAIs
in applicable Tribal Lands, and assessed the needs of eligible CAIs, including what types of
CAIs it intends to serve; which institutions, if any, it considered but declined to classify as
CAIs; and, if the Eligible Entity proposes service to one or more CAIs in a category not
explicitly cited as a type of CAI in Section 60102(a)(2)(E) of the Infrastructure Act, the basis
on which the Eligible Entity determined that such category of CAI facilitates greater use of
broadband service by vulnerable populations.

7. Include a detailed plan to conduct a challenge process as described in Section IV.B.6.

8. Include a detailed plan to competitively award subgrants consistent with Section IV.B.7.a
of this NOFO with regard to both last-mile broadband deployment projects and other eligible
activities. With respect to last-mile broadband deployment projects, the plan must explain
how the Eligible Entity will ensure timely deployment of broadband and minimize the BEAD
subsidy required to serve consumers consistent with Section IV.B.7 and the other priorities
set out in this NOFO. The Initial Proposal must include identification of, or a detailed
process for identifying, an Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold to be utilized during
the subgrantee selection process described in Section IV.B.7 of this NOFO. Each Eligible
Entity must establish its Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold in a manner that
maximizes use of the best available technology while ensuring that the program can meet the
prioritization and scoring requirements set forth in Section IV.B.7.b of this NOFO. NTIA
expects Eligible Entities to set the Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold as high as
possible to help ensure that end-to-end fiber projects are deployed wherever feasible.

9. With respect to non-deployment eligible activities, explain any preferences the Eligible
Entity will employ in selecting the type of initiatives it intends to support using BEAD
Program funds, the means by which subgrantees for these eligible activities will be selected,
how the Eligible Entity expects the initiatives it pursues to address the needs of the Eligible
Entity’s residents, the ways in which engagement with localities and stakeholders will inform

41 For States and Territories that have completed Five-Year Action Plans, reference to this plan satisfies
this requirement.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 31

the selection of eligible activities, and any efforts the Eligible Entity will undertake to
determine whether other uses of the funds might be more effective in achieving the BEAD
Program’s equity, access, and deployment goals.

10. Describe any initiatives the Eligible Entity proposes to implement as the recipient without
making a subgrant, and why it proposes that approach.

11. Detail how the Eligible Entity will ensure that subgrantees, contractors, and
subcontractors use strong labor standards and protections, such as those listed in Section
IV.C.1.e, and how the Eligible Entity will implement and apply the labor-related subgrantee
selection criteria described below in Section IV.C.1.e of this NOFO.

12. Detail how the Eligible Entity will ensure an available, diverse, and highly skilled
workforce consistent with Section IV.C.1.e of this NOFO.

13. Describe the process, strategy, and data tracking method(s) that the Eligible Entity will
implement to ensure that minority businesses, women-owned business enterprises, and labor
surplus area firms are recruited, used, and retained when possible.

14. Identify steps that the Eligible Entity will take to reduce costs and barriers to deployment,
promote the use of existing infrastructure, promote and adopt dig-once policies, streamlined
permitting processes and cost-effective access to poles, conduits, easements, and rights of
way, including the imposition of reasonable access requirements. [42]

15. Provide an assessment of climate threats within the Eligible Entity and proposed
mitigation methods consistent with the requirements of Section IV.C.1.h of this NOFO.

16. Describe the low-cost plan(s) that must be offered by subgrantees consistent with the
requirements of Section IV.C.2.c.i of this NOFO.

17. Describe the intended use of the 20 percent of total funding allocation that is made
available upon approval of the Initial Proposal consistent with Section IV.B.8 of this NOFO.

18. Disclose (1) whether the Eligible Entity will waive all laws of the Eligible Entity
concerning broadband, utility services, or similar subjects, whether they predate or postdate
enactment of the Infrastructure Act, that either (a) preclude certain public sector providers
from participation in the subgrant competition or (b) impose specific requirements on public
sector entities, such as limitations on the sources of financing, the required imputation of
costs not actually incurred by the public sector entity, or restrictions on the service a public
sector entity can offer; and (2) if it will not waive all such laws for BEAD Program project
selection purposes, identify those that it will not waive and describe how they will be applied
in connection with the competition for subgrants.

19. Certify the intent of the Eligible Entity to comply with all applicable requirements of the
Program, including the reporting requirements, and describe subgrantee accountability
procedures.

42 Consistent with the goal that Eligible Entities seek to minimize the BEAD funding outlay on a
particular project, Eligible Entities and their political subdivisions are strongly encouraged to remove time
and cost barriers associated with BEAD projects, including by expediting permitting timelines and
waiving fees where applicable, where doing so does not undermine other critical policy goals.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 32

Additional requirements for the Initial Proposal may be provided to Eligible Entities when the
Notices of Available Amounts are released.

In drafting its Initial Proposal, an Eligible Entity should keep in mind that it may allocate grant
funds for the following:

1. Deploying and/or upgrading broadband network facilities in connection with an Unserved
Service Project or an Underserved Service Project; [43]
2. Deploying and/or upgrading broadband network facilities to provide or improve service
to an eligible community anchor institution; [44]
3. Data collection, broadband mapping, and planning to the extent necessary beyond the
planning fund allocation to facilitate the goals and deliverables of the BEAD Program;
4. Installing internet and Wi-Fi infrastructure or providing reduced-cost broadband within a
multi-family residential building, with priority given to a residential building that has
substantial share of unserved households or is in a location in which the percentage of
individuals with a household income that is at or below 150 percent of the poverty line [45]
applicable to a family of the size involved is higher than the national percentage of such
individuals;
5. Broadband adoption, including programs to provide affordable internet-capable devices;
6. Training and workforce development; and
7. Other uses, including other Digital Equity programs not already included above,
proposed by Eligible Entities and approved in advance in writing by the Assistant
Secretary that support the goals of the Program. [46]

45 As determined under Section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. §
9902(2)).

46 Requests for approval of uses not listed here should be made in writing to the Assistant Secretary and
submitted through the appropriate Federal Program Officer. Eligible Entities should make such requests
on a timely basis to facilitate resolution prior to the point at which the Eligible Entity seeks to make the
expenditure or expenditures at issue.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 33

Initial Proposals after the Initial Proposal has been submitted. In reviewing the Initial Proposal,
the Assistant Secretary shall determine whether the use of funds proposed in the Initial Proposal:

1. Complies with Section 60102(f) of the Infrastructure Act;

2. Is in the public interest; and

3. Effectuates the purposes of the Infrastructure Act.

**d.** **Actions upon completion of review**

**i.** **Approval**

If the Assistant Secretary determines that the Initial Proposal meets the standards set forth in
Section IV.B.5.c, the Assistant Secretary shall approve the Initial Proposal, inform the Eligible
Entity, and make available to the Eligible Entity 20 percent of its Total Allocation; or a higher
percentage at the sole discretion of the Assistant Secretary, for uses as described in Section
IV.B.8 of this NOFO.

**ii.** **Disapproval**

If the Initial Proposal is incomplete, or the Assistant Secretary determines that the use of funds
proposed in the Initial Proposal does not meet the standards set forth in Section IV.B.5.c, the
Assistant Secretary shall notify the Eligible Entity of deficiencies in the proposal, provide the
Eligible Entity with an opportunity to resubmit the Initial Proposal, and establish a deadline for
resubmission. If an Eligible Entity fails to resubmit an Initial Proposal that remedies the
deficiencies identified by the Assistant Secretary by the applicable deadline, the Eligible Entity
will be treated as an application failure pursuant to Section IV.B.10. NTIA will provide technical
assistance to Eligible Entities in the revision process with the goal of ensuring an approved
Initial Proposal for each participating Eligible Entity.

**6.** **Challenge Process**

Each Eligible Entity shall develop and describe in the Initial Proposal, a transparent, evidencebased, fair, and expeditious challenge process under which a unit of local government, nonprofit
organization, or broadband service provider can challenge a determination made by the Eligible
Entity in the Initial Proposal as to whether a particular location or community anchor institution
within the jurisdiction of the Eligible Entity is eligible for grant funds. Among other things, the
process must allow for challenges regarding whether a particular location is unserved or
underserved as those terms are defined in the Infrastructure Act and Section I.C if this NOFO. [47]
Eligible Entities should update the data provided in their Initial Proposal to reflect the most
recently published version of the Broadband DATA Maps available as of the initiation of the
challenge process.

47 The fact that a location is served does not preclude its inclusion in an Unserved Service Project or an
Underserved Service Project, as these terms contemplate that such projects may include served and (in the
case of Unserved Service Projects) underserved locations. For example, a particular Unserved Service
Project containing 10 total locations may have 8 unserved locations and 2 that are served.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 34

The Assistant Secretary may modify the challenge process proposed by the Eligible Entity as
necessary and shall inform the Eligible Entity of any modifications required. Once an Eligible
Entity makes any required modifications, the Assistant Secretary shall approve the challenge
process, either in conjunction with, or prior to, approval of the Eligible Entity’s Initial Proposal.
The Eligible Entity shall conduct the approved challenge process before allocating grant funds
received from BEAD for the deployment of broadband networks to subgrantees. [48]

After resolving each challenge and at least 60 days before allocating grant funds for network
deployment, an Eligible Entity must provide public notice of the final classification of each
unserved location, underserved location, or Eligible Community Anchor Institution within the
jurisdiction of the Eligible Entity. An Eligible Entity must also notify NTIA of any modifications
to the Initial Proposal that are necessitated by successful challenges to its initial determinations.
Pursuant to the discretionary authority granted to the Assistant Secretary in the Infrastructure
Act, NTIA may reverse the determination of an Eligible Entity with respect to the eligibility of a
particular location or community anchor institution.

**7.** **Subgrantee Selection Process**

Each Eligible Entity must establish fair, open, and competitive processes for selecting
subgrantees. [49] The selection of subgrantees is a critically important process that will determine
which providers will bring service to all Americans, and in many cases, which entities will stand
up and operate training programs and take other actions aimed at closing the digital divide. [50]
Eligible Entities’ selection processes must be made clear to potential subgrantees and must be
described in the Eligible Entity’s Initial Proposal and Final Proposal. NTIA recognizes that there
may be a variety of competitive processes Eligible Entities might use to select subgrantees and
does not mandate any specific approach. Each Eligible Entity is encouraged to invite
participation in the process by a broad cross-section of potential subgrantees, including minorityowned business and other socially or economically disadvantaged individual-owned businesses.
NTIA will provide further guidance and technical assistance on approaches to subgrantee
selection.

**a.** **General Principles Governing Subgrantee Selection**

**i.** **Protecting the Integrity of the Selection Process**

In establishing a fair, open, equitable, and competitive selection process, each Eligible Entity
must ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity of the competition,
including safeguards against collusion, bias, conflicts of interest, arbitrary decisions, and other
factors that could undermine confidence in the process.

48 Eligible Entities may, but are not required to, update their post-challenge data to reflect updates to the
Broadband DATA Maps that occur after conclusion of the challenge process.

49 Subgrantees must meet the minimum qualifications set forth in Section IV.D of this NOFO.

50 Eligible Entities must subgrant funds in connection with broadband deployment projects and may also
subgrant funds for non-deployment activities. As a recipient, however, an Eligible Entity may also decide
to carry out non-deployment activities themselves.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 35

**ii.** **Last-Mile Broadband Deployment Projects**

When selecting subgrantees to provide broadband service to Unserved Service Projects,
Underserved Service Projects, and Eligible Community Anchor Institutions (“last-mile
broadband deployment projects”), each Eligible Entity must apply a process that abides by the
following principles:

1. An “Unserved Service Project” or “Underserved Service Project” can be as small as a
single unserved or underserved location, respectively. This principle will help ensure that
isolated unserved and underserved locations that cannot be aggregated in groups that are 80
percent or more unserved or underserved are addressed by the BEAD Program.

2. An “Unserved Service Project” or “Underserved Service Project” may include Middle
Mile Infrastructure in or through any area required to reach interconnection points or
otherwise to ensure the technical feasibility and financial sustainability of a project providing
service to an unserved location, underserved location, or eligible CAI. [51]

3. In identifying an Unserved Service Project or Underserved Service Project, an Eligible
Entity may not treat as “unserved” or “underserved” any location that is already subject to an
enforceable federal, state, or local commitment to deploy qualifying broadband as of the date
that the challenge process described in Section IV.B.6 of this NOFO is concluded. [52] The

51 *See* Infrastructure Act § 60102(h)(4)(E).

52 An enforceable commitment for the deployment of qualifying broadband to a location exists when the
commitment to deploy qualifying broadband service to that location was made as a condition of:

  - Any grant, loan, or loan guarantee provided by an Eligible Entity to the provider of broadband
service;

  - Any grant, loan, or loan guarantee provided by the Secretary of Agriculture under:

`o` Title VI of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. § 950bb *et seq* .), including:
any program to provide grants, loans, or loan guarantees under Sections 601 through 603
of that Act (7 U.S.C. § 950bb *et seq* .); and the Community Connect Grant Program
established under Section 604 of that Act (7 U.S.C. § 950bb–3); or
`o` The broadband loan and grant pilot program known as the “Rural eConnectivity Pilot
Program” or the “ReConnect Notice of Funding Opportunity Program” authorized under
Section 779 of division A of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (Public Law
115–141; 132 Stat. 348);

  - Any high-cost universal service support provided under Section 254 of the Communications Act
of 1934 (47 U.S.C. § 254), except that in the case of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, a
location will be considered to have an enforceable commitment for qualifying broadband only (a)
after the Federal Communications Commission has announced in a Public Notice that RDOF
support for that location is ready-to-authorize or is authorized, and (b) the provider does not rely
on satellite technologies to deliver service;

  - Any grant provided under Section 6001 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
(47 U.S.C. § 1305);

  - Amounts made available for the Education Stabilization Fund established under the heading
“DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION” in title VIII of division B of the CARES Act (Public Law
116–136; 134 Stat. 564), and funded under the CARES Act, the Coronavirus Response and Relief
Supplemental Appropriations Act (CRRSA Act), and the American Rescue Plan Act (ARP Act);

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 36

Assistant Secretary may waive such treatment of locations or areas with prior enforceable
commitments at the request of the Eligible Entity in cases where the Eligible Entity can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Assistant Secretary that such treatment of such
locations or areas is necessary to achieve the goals of the program, including where
purported commitments do not have the appropriate documentation with respect to Tribal
lands consistent with requirements set out above. [53] For the purposes of the subgrantee
selection process, “qualifying broadband” to a location that is not a CAI is Reliable
Broadband Service with (i) a speed of not less than 100 Mbps for downloads; and (ii) a speed
of not less than 20 Mbps for uploads; and (iii) latency less than or equal to 100 milliseconds;
“qualifying broadband” to a CAI is Reliable Broadband Service with (i) a speed of not less
than 1 Gbps for downloads and uploads alike and (ii) latency less than or equal to 100
milliseconds.

4. An Eligible Entity must establish a competitive process designed to maximize the public
benefits achieved through the subgrant process by increasing subgrantee-provided match and
reducing costs to consumers. The type of competitive process selected is at the discretion of
the Eligible Entity, subject to the Assistant Secretary’s approval in reviewing the Eligible
Entity’s Initial Proposal and to the criteria and other requirements set forth in this NOFO.

5. The Eligible Entity may seek proposals to serve unserved locations, underserved locations,
and CAIs collectively or separately, so long as the Eligible Entity awards funding in a
manner that prioritizes Unserved Service Projects and once it certifies that it will ensure
coverage of all unserved locations within the Eligible Entity, prioritizes Underserved Service
Projects.

6. The Eligible Entity may not exclude, as a class, cooperatives, nonprofit organizations,
public-private partnerships, private companies, public or private utilities, public utility
districts, or local governments from eligibility as a subgrantee.

  - Amounts made available for the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF)
established under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public Law 117–2; 135 Stat. 4)
(ARPA);

  - Amounts made available for the Capital Projects Fund established by Section 604 of the Social
Security Act, as added by Section 9901 of ARPA; or

  - Any other grant, loan, or loan guarantee provided by, or funded in whole or in part by, the federal
government or a State or Territorial government for the provision of broadband service.

Eligible Entities may fund Unserved Service Projects and Underserved Service Projects that include
locations in an area that has an enforceable commitment for the deployment of qualifying broadband to
less than 100 percent of the locations in that area. *See, e.g.*, 47 C.F.R. § 54.308(a). Eligible Entities must,
however, seek to identify as part of the challenge process described in Section IV.B.6 of this NOFO those
unserved locations and underserved that will not be served by qualifying broadband service as a result of
such enforceable commitment, and use that information in determining whether to treat each location as
unserved or underserved within the relevant area.

Further, for unserved locations and underserved on Tribal Lands, a commitment that otherwise meets the
criteria set forth above shall not constitute an enforceable commitment for the deployment of qualifying
broadband unless it includes a legally binding agreement, which includes a Tribal Government
Resolution, between the Tribal Government of the Tribal Lands encompassing that location, or its
authorized agent, and a service provider offering qualifying broadband service to that location.

53 *See supra* note 52.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 37

7. The Eligible Entity may solicit proposals from prospective subgrantees at the geographic
level of its choosing—for example, on a per-location basis, per-census block basis, per-town,
per-county or another geographic unit. An Eligible Entity may alternatively solicit proposals
for project areas it defines or ask prospective subgrantees to define their own proposed
project areas. If the Eligible Entity allows prospective subgrantees to define proposed project
areas, it must develop a mechanism for de-conflicting overlapping proposals (for example, by
de-scoping some locations from a provider’s proposed project area) to allow for like-to-like
comparison of competing proposals. Whatever process is selected, the Eligible Entity must
ensure it has a plan for serving all unserved and (where it has sufficient funding) underserved
locations.

8. Each Eligible Entity must require that each proposal from a prospective subgrantee
identify, for each location to be served in the proposal, the amount of BEAD funding the
prospective subgrantee is seeking to serve that location.

9. If, after soliciting proposals, the Eligible Entity has received no proposals to serve a
location or group of locations that are unserved, underserved, or a combination unserved and
underserved, the Eligible Entity may engage with existing providers and/or other prospective
subgrantees to find providers willing to expand their existing or proposed service areas. An
Eligible Entity may consider inducements such as use of state funding toward the match
requirement set forth in Section III.B or benefits during the grant selection process ( *e.g.*,
points or credits). The Eligible Entity shall, in this circumstance, work to ensure that its
approach is as transparent as possible. For the avoidance of doubt, this provider-specific
outreach is only appropriate after the Eligible Entity has solicited proposals and failed to
obtain one or more proposals to serve the location or locations at issue.

10. As discussed further in Section IV.B.9.b, if an Eligible Entity’s Final Proposal includes
plans to deploy broadband to Unserved Service Projects or Underserved Service Projects that
include any locations on Tribal Lands, the Eligible Entity must submit proof of the Tribal
Government’s consent to such deployment.

11. Notwithstanding any of the above:

`o` An Eligible Entity may decline to select a proposal that requires a BEAD subsidy
that exceeds the Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold for any location to
be served in the proposal if use of an alternative Reliable Broadband Service
technology meeting the BEAD Program’s technical requirements would be less
expensive. Subject to the overarching requirement to run a fair, open, and
competitive process, the Eligible Entity has discretion to design a selection
process that allows it to engage with a prospective subgrantee to revise the
proposal to ensure that no location requires a subsidy that exceeds the Extremely
High Cost Per Location Threshold.

`o` If no Reliable Broadband Service technology meeting the BEAD Program’s
technical requirements would be deployable for a subsidy of less than the
Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold at a given location, an Eligible
Entity is authorized to select a proposal involving a less costly technology for that
location, even if that technology does *not* meet the definition of Reliable
Broadband Service but otherwise satisfies the Program’s technical requirements.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 38

In this instance, Eligible Entities are directed to seek out the most robust,
affordable, and scalable technologies achievable under the circumstances
particular to that location.

Eligible uses of funding in connection with last-mile broadband deployment projects include the
following: [54]

1. Construction, improvement, and/or acquisition of facilities and telecommunications
equipment required to provide qualifying broadband service, including infrastructure for
backhaul, middle- and last-mile networks, and multi-tenant buildings.
2. Long-term leases (for terms greater than one year) of facilities required to provide
qualifying broadband service, including indefeasible right-of-use (IRU) agreements.
3. Deployment of internet and Wi-Fi infrastructure within an eligible multi-family
residential building.
4. Engineering design, permitting, and work related to environmental, historical and cultural
reviews.
5. Personnel costs, including salaries and fringe benefits for staff and consultants providing
services directly connected to the implementation of the BEAD Program (such as project
managers, program directors, and subject matter experts).
6. Network software upgrades, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity solutions.
7. Training for cybersecurity professionals who will be working on BEAD-funded
networks.
8. Workforce development, including Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships,
and community college and/or vocational training for broadband-related occupations to
support deployment, maintenance, and upgrades.

**iii.** **Non-Deployment Uses**

As detailed above, an Eligible Entity that can demonstrate it has a plan for bringing affordable,
high-speed broadband service to all unserved and underserved locations within its jurisdiction
may also allocate funding to non-deployment activities. Such eligible non-deployment uses
include, but are not limited to, the following:

1. User training with respect to cybersecurity, privacy, and other digital safety matters.
2. Remote learning or telehealth services/facilities.
3. Digital literacy/upskilling (from beginner-level to advanced).
4. Computer science, coding and cybersecurity education programs.
5. Implementation of Eligible Entity digital equity plans (to supplement, but not to duplicate
or supplant, Planning Grant funds received by the Eligible Entity in connection with the
Digital Equity Act of 2021). [55]

54 These also are the uses to which an Eligible Entity must in the first instance devote funding in the initial
20 percent funding distribution, pursuant to Section IV.B.7 of this NOFO.
55 Note that an Eligible Entity that wishes to obtain a Digital Equity Capacity Grant under the Digital
Equity Act of 2021 must first apply for and receive a Digital Equity Planning Grant in order to do so. The
application for BEAD funding will not be considered an application for a grant under the Digital Equity
Act of 2021. Use of BEAD funds for digital equity purposes will not alone render the Eligible Entity

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 39

6. Broadband sign-up assistance and programs that provide technology support.
7. Multi-lingual outreach to support adoption and digital literacy.
8. Prisoner education to promote pre-release digital literacy, job skills, online jobacquisition skills, *etc* .
9. Digital navigators. [56]
10. Direct subsidies for use toward broadband subscription, where the Eligible Entity shows
the subsidies will improve affordability for the end user population (and to supplement,
but not to duplicate or supplant, the subsidies provided by the Affordable Connectivity
Program).
11. Costs associated with stakeholder engagement, including travel, capacity-building, or
contract support.
12. Other allowable costs necessary to carrying out programmatic activities of an award, not
to include ineligible costs described below in Section V.H.2 of this NOFO.

When selecting subgrantees for non-deployment uses of BEAD funds, an Eligible Entity must
adhere to the Infrastructure Act’s requirement that subgrants be awarded “competitively.” [57]
NTIA recognizes that the breadth of potential non-deployment eligible activities could
necessitate a broad range of subgrantee selection processes, even within a single Eligible Entity,
and that such processes might even require the Eligible Entity to compare and choose among
very different proposals ( *e.g.*, whether to allocate funds to an affordability program, a
cybersecurity training program, or a digital literacy drive). [58] Accordingly, NTIA does not
prescribe any specific framework. NTIA reminds Eligible Entities that federal grant regulations
“flow through” to subrecipients ( *i.e.*, subgrantees), and that subrecipients are responsible for
adherence to applicable Federal program requirements specified in the Federal award. [59] As with
deployment projects, NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to promote participation by minorityowned businesses and other socially or economically disadvantaged individual-owned
businesses.

**b.** **Prioritization and Scoring in Selection of Last-Mile Broadband**
**Deployment Projects**

An Eligible Entity may choose its own means of competitively selecting subgrantees for lastmile broadband deployment projects, subject to approval by the Assistant Secretary (during
review of the Eligible Entity’s Initial Proposal). Each Eligible Entity’s subgrantee selection
process must, however, incorporate the following principles to satisfy the Infrastructure Act’s
mandates and the BEAD Program’s goals.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 40

1. ***Complete Coverage of Unserved Locations and Underserved Locations, Followed by***
***Prioritization of Eligible CAIs.*** The Eligible Entity, in awarding subgrants for the
deployment of a broadband network, shall award funding in a manner that ensures the
deployment of service to all unserved locations within the Eligible Entity’s jurisdiction. If
the Eligible Entity has sufficient funds to ensure deployment of service to all underserved
locations within its jurisdiction, it must ensure such deployment as well. If the Eligible
Entity lacks sufficient funds to ensure deployment of service to all underserved locations,
it must commit the remainder of its BEAD funds to ensure deployment to underserved
locations. Eligible Entities must submit Initial Proposals and Final Proposals that will
result in coverage for all unserved locations, and (to the extent funds are available) all
underserved locations. The Assistant Secretary will only approve an Initial Proposal or
Final Proposal that includes a plan to ensure deployment of broadband to all unserved
and underserved locations within the State or Territory or that provides a strong showing
that the Eligible Entity is financially incapable of ensuring universal coverage of all
unserved and underserved locations. To the extent that an Eligible Entity demonstrates
that there are insufficient funds available to fund deployment to all unserved,
underserved, or eligible CAI locations, the Eligible Entity must prioritize projects within
each of those categories based on a strong preference for projects in high poverty areas or
persistent poverty counties. [60]

In ensuring deployment of service to all unserved and underserved locations within its
jurisdiction, the Eligible Entity may opt to fund deployment of Wi-Fi infrastructure to
multi-family buildings that lack high-speed broadband access in their entirety or contain
units that lack such access. Such an Eligible Entity must give priority to residential
buildings that (1) have a substantial share of unserved households or (2) are in locations
in which the percentage of individuals with a household income that is at or below 150
percent of the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved [61] is higher than the
national percentage of such individuals. [62]

NTIA strongly urges Eligible Entities that are able to fund deployment to all unserved
and underserved locations to allocate remaining funds to eligible CAIs, and to move to
alternative eligible uses only if they are able to fund deployments to all unserved
locations, underserved locations, and eligible CAIs. An Eligible Entity that proposes to
use BEAD funds to pursue objectives in lieu of the deployment of service to eligible
CAIs must provide a strong rationale for doing so in its Initial Proposal.

The requirement that an Eligible Entity have a plan to ensure deployment to all unserved
and underserved locations before contemplating non-deployment uses of funds does not

60 For the purposes of this requirement, high poverty areas are areas in which the percentage of
individuals with a household income that is at or below 150 percent of the poverty line applicable to a
family of the size involved (as determined under Section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant
Act (42 U.S.C. § 9902(2)) is higher than the national percentage of such individuals. Persistent poverty
counties are counties that have had poverty rates of 20 percent or greater for at least 30 years as calculated
by the Economic Research Service in the Department of Agriculture.

61 For this purpose, the applicable poverty line for a family of the relevant size is to be determined
consistent with section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act, 42 U.S.C. § 9902(2).

62 *See* Infrastructure Act § 60102(g)(1)(D).

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 41

impose any temporal requirement as to the order in which BEAD-funded initiatives are
undertaken or completed. NTIA recognizes that broadband deployment projects often
take months or years to complete, whereas certain other eligible uses of BEAD funds can
be implemented more quickly. Thus, if an Eligible Entity has a plan to deploy service to
all unserved and underserved locations within its jurisdiction, it may pursue nondeployment initiatives using BEAD funds before or while deployment projects are
underway. For example, while an Eligible Entity is only permitted to pursue a devicesubsidy program using BEAD funds if it has a plan to deploy service to all unserved and
underserved locations within its jurisdiction, an Eligible Entity proposing such a program
is both permitted and encouraged to implement it as soon as is feasible once its Initial
Proposal has been approved.

2. ***Selection Among Competing Proposals for the Same Location or Locations.*** An
Eligible Entity’s process in selecting subgrantees for last-mile broadband deployment
projects must first assess which locations or sets of locations under consideration are
subject to one or more proposals that (1) constitute Priority Broadband Projects and (2)
satisfy all other requirements set out in this NOFO with respect to subgrantees. In the
event there is just one proposed Priority Broadband Project in a location or set of
locations, and that proposal does not exceed the Eligible Entity’s Extremely High Cost
Per Location Threshold, that proposal is the default winner, unless the Eligible Entity
requests, and the Assistant Secretary grants, a waiver allowing the Eligible Entity to
select an alternative project. [63] To the extent there are multiple proposals in a location or
set of locations that (1) constitute Priority Broadband Projects and (2) satisfy all other
requirements with respect to subgrantees, the Eligible Entity shall use its approved
competitive process to select a project subject to the selection criteria set forth below.

**i.** **Selection Among Priority Broadband Projects**

***Definition.*** The Infrastructure Act provides that a “priority broadband project” is one designed to
(1) “provide broadband service that meets speed, latency, reliability, consistency in quality of
service, and related criteria as the Assistant Secretary shall determine” and (2) “ensure that the
network built by the project can easily scale speeds over time to … meet the evolving
connectivity needs of households and businesses” and “support the deployment of 5G, successor
wireless technologies, and other advanced services.” [64] NTIA has determined that “Priority
Broadband Projects” are those that use end-to-end fiber-optic architecture. Only end-to-end fiber
will “ensure that the network built by the project can easily scale speeds over time to … meet the
evolving connectivity needs of households and businesses” and “support the deployment of 5G,
successor wireless technologies, and other advanced services.” [65] End-to-end fiber networks can
be updated by replacing equipment attached to the ends of the fiber-optic facilities, allowing for
quick and relatively inexpensive network scaling as compared to other technologies. Moreover,
new fiber deployments will facilitate the deployment and growth of 5G and other advanced
wireless services, which rely extensively on fiber for essential backhaul.

63 The Eligible Entity need not seek a waiver before rejecting a project whose costs, on average or for a
given location, exceed the Eligible Entity’s Extremely High Cost Per Location Threshold.

64 Infrastructure Act § 60102(a)(1)(I).

65 *Id.*

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 42

***Primary Criteria.*** In deciding among competing Priority Broadband Projects covering the same
location or locations, Eligible Entities must give the greatest weight ( *e.g.*, substantial points or
credits) to the following criteria: [66]

     - ***Minimal BEAD Program Outlay.*** The total BEAD funding that will be required
to complete the project, accounting for both total projected cost and the
prospective subgrantee’s proposed match (which must, absent a waiver, cover no
less than 25 percent of the project cost), with the specific points or credits
awarded increasing as the BEAD outlay decreases. In comparing the project’s
BEAD outlay and the prospective subgrantee’s match commitments, Eligible
Entities should consider the cost to the Program per location while accounting for
any factors in network design that might make a project more expensive, but also
more scalable or resilient.

     - ***Affordability.*** The prospective subgrantee’s commitment to provide the most
affordable total price to the customer for 1 Gbps/1 Gbps service in the project

area.

     - ***Fair Labor Practices.*** Eligible Entities must give priority to projects based on a
prospective subgrantee’s demonstrated record of and plans to be in compliance
with Federal labor and employment laws. New entrants without a record of labor
and employment law compliance must be permitted to mitigate this fact by
making specific, forward-looking commitments to strong labor and employment
standards and protections with respect to BEAD-funded projects. This
prioritization requirement is described in further detail in Section IV.C.1.e of this
NOFO.

***Secondary Criterion.*** Eligible Entities must also give weight ( *e.g.*, some number of points or
quantity of credits less than the amount given to the criteria above) to the following criterion:

     - ***Speed to Deployment.*** All subgrantees that receive BEAD Program funds for
network deployment must deploy the planned broadband network and begin
providing services to each customer that desires broadband services within the
project area not later than four years after the date on which the subgrantee
receives the subgrant from the Eligible Entity. Eligible Entities must give
secondary criterion prioritization weight to the prospective subgrantee’s binding
commitment to provide service by an earlier date certain, subject to contractual
penalties to the Eligible Entity, with greater benefits awarded to applicants
promising an earlier service provision date. [67]

66 The primary criteria must collectively account for no less than three-quarters of the total benefits
available across all the criteria the Eligible Entity employs in choosing between or among competing
proposals.

67 Nothing herein supersedes the requirement that, barring an extension granted by the Assistant
Secretary, any subgrantee that receives BEAD Program funds for network deployment must deploy the

***Additional Prioritization Factors.*** Eligible Entities may develop additional secondary criteria to
be given weights that align with Eligible Entity and local priorities, subject to the requirement to
give the greatest weight to the primary criteria and the approval of the Assistant Secretary in the
Initial and Final Proposal process. In particular, NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to incorporate
the following as selection criteria:

     - ***Equitable Workforce Development and Job Quality.*** NTIA encourages Eligible
Entities to adopt selection criteria relating to the subgrantee’s enforceable
commitments with respect to advancing equitable workforce development and job
quality objectives, *see* Section IV.C.1.f of this NOFO.

     - ***Open Access.*** NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to adopt selection criteria
promoting subgrantees’ provision of open access wholesale last-mile broadband
service for the life of the subsidized networks, on fair, equal, and neutral terms to
all potential retail providers.

     - ***Local and Tribal Coordination.*** NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to adopt
selection criteria reflecting a prospective subgrantee’s support from the local
and/or Tribal Government with oversight over the location or locations to be
served.

ii. **Selection Among Other Last-Mile Broadband**
**Deployment Projects**

With respect to locations or sets of locations for which the Eligible Entity did not receive a
proposal to deploy a Priority Broadband Project, the Eligible Entity shall first identify any
locations with only one proposal that satisfies all other requirements with respect to subgrantees.
In those locations or sets of locations, the entity submitting the sole proposal is the default
winner, unless the Eligible Entity requests, and the Assistant Secretary grants, a waiver allowing
the Eligible Entity to seek other potential subgrantees. To the extent there are multiple proposals
seeking to serve a location or area that satisfy all other requirements with respect to subgrantees,
the Eligible Entity shall undertake its competitive process to choose between or among those
proposals.

***Primary Criteria.*** In deciding among competing projects that are not Priority Broadband Projects
covering the same locations or area, Eligible Entities must give the greatest weight ( *e.g.*,
substantial points or credits) to the following criteria: [68]

     - ***Minimal BEAD Program Outlay.*** The total BEAD funding that will be required
to complete the project, accounting for both total projected cost and the
prospective subgrantee’s proposed match (which must, absent a waiver, cover no

planned broadband network and begin providing services to each customer that desires broadband service
within the project area not later than four years after the date on which the subgrantee receives the
subgrant from the Eligible Entity.

68 The primary criteria must collectively account for no less than three-quarters of the total benefits
available across all the criteria the Eligible Entity employs in choosing between or among competing
proposals.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 44

less than 25 percent of the project cost), with the specific benefits awarded
increasing as the BEAD outlay decreases. In comparing the project’s BEAD
outlay and the prospective subgrantee’s match commitments, Eligible Entities
should consider the cost to the Program per location while accounting for any
factors in network design that might make a project more expensive, but also
more scalable or resilient.

     - ***Affordability.*** The prospective subgrantee’s commitment to provide the most
affordable total price to the customer for 100/20 Mbps service in the proposed
service area.

     - ***Fair Labor Practices.*** Eligible Entities must give priority to projects based on a
prospective subgrantee’s demonstrated record of and plans to be in compliance
with Federal labor and employment laws. New entrants without a record of labor
and employment law compliance must be permitted to mitigate this fact by
making specific, forward-looking commitments to strong labor and employment
standards and protections with respect to BEAD-funded projects. This
prioritization requirement is described in further detail in Section IV.C.1.e of this
NOFO.

***Secondary Criteria.*** Eligible Entities must also give weight ( *e.g.*, some number of points or
credits less than the amount given to the criteria above) to the following criteria:

     - ***Speed to Deployment.*** The prospective subgrantee’s binding commitment to
provision service by a date certain, subject to contractual penalties to the Eligible
Entity, with greater benefits awarded to prospective subgrantees promising an
earlier service provision date.

     - ***Speed of Network and Other Technical Capabilities.*** Eligible Entities must
weigh the speeds, latency, and other technical capabilities of the technologies
proposed by prospective subgrantees seeking to deploy projects that are not
Priority Broadband Projects. Applications proposing to use technologies that
exhibit greater ease of scalability with lower future investment (as defined by the
Eligible Entity) and whose capital assets have longer useable lives should be
afforded additional weight over those proposing technologies with higher costs to
upgrade and shorter capital asset cycles.

***Additional Prioritization Factors.*** Eligible Entities may develop additional secondary criteria to
be given weights that align with Eligible Entity and local priorities, subject to the requirement to
give the greatest weight to the primary criteria and the approval of the Assistant Secretary in the
Initial and Final Proposal process. In particular, NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to incorporate
the following as selection criteria:

     - ***Equitable Workforce Development and Job Quality.*** NTIA encourages Eligible
Entities to adopt selection criteria relating to the subgrantee’s enforceable
commitments with respect to advancing equitable workforce development and job
quality objectives, *see* Section IV.C.1.f of this NOFO.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 45

     - ***Open Access.*** NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to adopt selection criteria
promoting subgrantees’ provision of open access wholesale last-mile broadband
service for the life of the subsidized networks, on fair, equal, and neutral terms to
all potential retail providers.

     - ***Local and Tribal Coordination.*** NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to adopt
selection criteria reflecting a prospective subgrantee’s support from the local
and/or Tribal Government with oversight over the location or locations to be
served.

**8.** **20 Percent Funding Release and Eligible Uses**

If the Assistant Secretary determines that the Initial Proposal meets the standards set forth in
Section IV.B.5.c, the Assistant Secretary shall make available to the Eligible Entity 20 percent of
the grant funds that were allocated to the Eligible Entity, or a higher percentage at the sole
discretion of the Assistant Secretary, for uses as described in Section IV.B.3 of this NOFO.

Upon completion of the challenge process described in Section IV.B.6 and the subgrantee
selection process described in Section IV.B.7, an Eligible Entity may use the funds made
available under this Section to fully fund deployment projects that:

1. Consist of at least 80 percent unserved locations; and

2. Are in a location in which the percentage of individuals with a household income at or
below 150 percent of the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved (as determined
under Section 673(2) of the Community Services Block Grant Act (42 U.S.C. § 9902(2)) that is
higher than the national percentage of such individuals.

An Eligible Entity may use the funds made available under this Section of the NOFO for other
eligible uses described under Section IV.B.7 of this NOFO ( *i.e.*, for uses other than deployment
of last-mile broadband infrastructure to unserved and underserved locations or eligible CAIs)
only if the Eligible Entity is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Assistant Secretary that
the Eligible Entity has a plan to meet the unserved and underserved location broadband
deployment commitments set forth in the Eligible Entity’s Final Proposal, in which case the
Assistant Secretary may waive, in whole or in part, limitations on the use of this funding round. [69]
Additional information on how to request the use of funds for other purposes and the associated
documentation required to demonstrate such plan will be provided at a later date.

**9.** **Final Proposal**

**a.** **Timing**

To receive the remaining grant funds that were allocated to the Eligible Entity, an Eligible Entity
shall submit a Final Proposal no later than twelve (12) months after the date upon which the
Assistant Secretary approves the Eligible Entity’s Initial Proposal. If an Eligible Entity fails to

69 As described above, moreover, the Eligible Entity need not wait for its last-mile deployment projects to
be completed before it can pursue its approved non-deployment uses. Rather, it is both permitted and
encouraged to undertake those non-deployment activities as soon as is feasible.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 46

submit a Final Proposal by this deadline, this will be treated as the Eligible Entity’s application
failure pursuant to Section IV.B.10. The Assistant Secretary reserves the right to extend this
deadline; however, the Assistant Secretary will not grant a waiver of the Final Proposal deadlines
except in extraordinary circumstances.

**b.** **Form and Content of Final Proposal**

NTIA will provide Eligible Entities an online template for submission of the Final Proposal. An
Eligible Entity may submit only one final proposal.

The Final Proposal must include, at a minimum:

1. A detailed plan that specifies the outcome of the Eligible Entity’s subgrantee selection
process and how the Eligible Entity will:

a. allocate grant funds to subgrantees for the deployment of broadband networks to
unserved locations, underserved locations, and (if applicable) CAIs in accordance with
the prioritization framework described in Section IV.B.7.b of this NOFO; and

b. align the grant funds allocated to the Eligible Entity under the BEAD Program, where
practicable, with the use of other funds for broadband that the Eligible Entity receives
from the federal government, an Eligible Entity, or any other source.

3. A timeline for implementation of the detailed plan and completion of each project and
other eligible activity to be funded;

4. Processes for oversight and accountability to ensure the proper use of the grant funds
allocated to the Eligible Entity under the BEAD Program consistent with Section IX.G of this
NOFO;

5. Certification that the Eligible Entity has conducted coordination, including with Tribal
Governments, local community organizations, and unions and worker organizations,
consistent with the requirements set forth in Section IV.C.1.c of this NOFO, a description of
the coordination conducted, and a summary of the impact such coordination had on the
content of the Final Proposal;

6. Description of the results of the challenge process conducted by the Eligible Entity under
Section IV.B.6;

7. Certification that the Eligible Entity will provide service to all unserved and underserved
locations, if the Eligible Entity is seeking to use BEAD funding for deployment to CAIs or
for other eligible activities;

8. A detailed description of all planned uses of BEAD funding that are not last-mile
broadband deployment projects, including the nature of each funded initiative, how those
uses are consistent with Section IV.B.7.a.iii of this NOFO, how the Eligible Entity expects
the initiative to address the needs of the Eligible Entity’s residents, the ways in which
engagement with localities and stakeholders informed the selection of such eligible activities,
and any efforts the Eligible Entity undertook to determine whether other uses of the funds
might have been more effective in achieving the BEAD Program’s equity, access, and
deployment goals;

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 47

9. The means by which subgrantees for non-deployment eligible activities were selected, if
the Eligible Entity pursued those initiatives via subgrant, or, alternatively, how the Eligible
Entity determined that it should undertake the initiative itself;

10. A description of efforts undertaken by the Eligible Entity to ensure the participation of
non-traditional broadband providers (such as municipalities or political subdivisions,
cooperatives, non-profits, Tribal Governments, and utilities), including an explanation for
awards to traditional broadband providers when one or more non-traditional providers
submitted competing proposals to serve an area consistent with the requirements of Section
IV.C.1.a;

11. Implementation status of plans described in the Initial Proposal related to:

a. Steps that the Eligible Entity has taken or intends to take to promote streamlined
permitting processes and cost-effective access to poles, conduits, easements, and rights of
way, including the imposition of reasonable access requirements;

b. Labor and workforce activities, including how the Eligible Entity implemented and
applied the labor-related subgrantee selection criterion required herein;

c. Utilization of minority businesses, women-owned business enterprises, and labor
surplus area firms;

d. Low-cost plan requirements; and

e. Climate change and resilience;

12. Information regarding specific commitments made by provisionally selected subgrantees
to warrant a project’s treatment as a Priority Broadband Project;

13. Information regarding specific commitments made by provisionally selected subgrantees
to warrant benefits in the Eligible Entity’s subgrantee selection process ( *e.g.*, the primary and
secondary criteria);

14. Environmental documentation associated with any construction and/or ground-disturbing
activities and a description of how the Eligible Entity will comply with applicable
environmental and national historical preservation requirements.

15. To the extent an Eligible Entity’s Final Proposal includes plans to deploy broadband to
Unserved Service Projects or Underserved Service Projects on Tribal Lands, the Eligible
Entity must submit a Resolution of Consent from each Tribal Government, from the Tribal
Council or other governing body, upon whose Tribal Lands the infrastructure will be
deployed [70] .

70 In the case of consortiums, a Tribal resolution is required from each Tribal Government on whose
Tribal Lands the infrastructure will be deployed. For projects deploying to locations on Tribal Lands in
Hawaii, consent must be obtained from the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. For projects deploying
to locations in Alaska, with the exception of deployments on the Metlakatla Reservation, an Eligible
Entity must gain the consent (by Tribal resolution) of 51 percent or more of the federally recognized tribal
governments in the Alaska Native Region in which the infrastructure will be deployed. Consent from the
Metlakatla Reservation will not be required for deployments in the Southeast Alaska Region Village.
Conversely, deployments within the Metlakatla Reservation will require only the consent (via Tribal
resolution) of the Metlakatla Reservation’s Tribal Government. If a Tribal Government is not meeting due
to COVID-19 restrictions or will not meet between release of this NOFO and submission of the Eligible
Entity’s Initial Proposal, NTIA will allow the submission of a Letter of Consent from the Governing
Body of the Tribe with the Eligible Entity’s Final Proposal.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 48

16. A description of (1) each unsuccessful application that was affected by laws of the
Eligible Entity concerning broadband, utility services, or similar subjects, whether they
predate or postdate enactment of the Infrastructure Act, that the Eligible Entity did not waive
for purposes of BEAD Program project selection and that either (a) preclude certain public
sector providers from participation in the subgrant competition or (b) impose specific
requirements on public sector entities, such as limitations on the sources of financing, the
required imputation of costs not actually incurred by the public sector entity, or restrictions
on the service a public sector entity can offer; and (2) how those laws impacted the decision
to deny each such application.

Additional requirements for the Final Proposal may be provided to Eligible Entities when the
approval of the Initial Proposal is granted.

**c.** **Review process**

After receipt of a Final Proposal, the Assistant Secretary shall acknowledge receipt and begin the
review process in the order in which Final Proposals are received. Upon determination that the
Final Proposal is complete, the Assistant Secretary shall determine whether the use of funds
proposed in the Final Proposal:

1. Complies with Section 60102(f) of the Infrastructure Act;

2. Is in the public interest; and

3. Effectuates the purposes of the Infrastructure Act.

The Assistant Secretary may request and accept corrections to the Final Proposal of an Eligible
Entity after the Final Proposal has been submitted.

**d.** **Actions Upon Completion of Review**

**i.** **Approval**

If the Assistant Secretary determines that the Final Proposal meets the standards set forth in
Section IV.B.9.c, the Assistant Secretary shall approve the Final Proposal, so inform the Eligible
Entity, and make available to the Eligible Entity the remaining Program funds identified in the
Eligible Entity’s Notice of Available Amounts to be used to implement the Eligible Entity’s
Final Proposal.

**ii.** **Disapproval**

If the Final Proposal is incomplete, or the Assistant Secretary determines that the use of funds
proposed in the Final Proposal does not meet the standards set forth in Section IV.B.9.c, the
Assistant Secretary will notify the Eligible Entity of the deficiencies in the proposal, provide the
Eligible Entity with an opportunity to resubmit the Final Proposal, and establish a deadline for
resubmission. If an Eligible Entity fails to resubmit its Final Proposal remedying the deficiencies
identified by the Assistant Secretary or otherwise does not satisfy the standards set forth in
Section IV.B.9.c by the applicable deadline, the Eligible Entity’s application may be treated as
an application failure pursuant to Section IV.B.10.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 49

**10.** **Application Failures**

If an Eligible Entity fails to submit a covered application ( *i.e.*, a Letter of Intent, Initial Proposal,
or Final Proposal) by the applicable deadline (and following any relevant opportunity to cure
deficiencies), NTIA will issue a public notice inviting a political subdivision or consortium of
political subdivisions of the Eligible Entity (a “Substitute Entity”) to submit the applicable type
of covered application in place of the Eligible Entity. In the case where an Eligible Entity has
missed a deadline opening the process to a Substitute Entity, NTIA will publish a public notice
to facilitate meaningful participation of political subdivisions.

In the case of a Substitute Entity that submits a covered application:

1. The Assistant Secretary shall, if necessary, establish revised deadlines for the
Substitute Entity to meet the requirements of this NOFO; and

2. Any reference in this NOFO to an Eligible Entity in a geographic sense shall be
deemed to refer to the Eligible Entity in whose place the Substitute Entity submitted the
covered application.

If no Substitute Entity applies or if the Substitute Entity fails to meet a submission deadline
without the grant of extension, an Eligible Entity’s Program funds may be reallocated pursuant to
Section II.D above.

**C.** **Program Requirements**

As set forth in the Infrastructure Act and outlined in greater detail below, the programmatic
requirements applicable to Eligible Entities and subgrantees are as follows:

1. Eligible Entity Obligations
a. Consider All Provider Types
b. Ensure Subgrantee Accountability
c. Local Coordination
d. Equitable and Nondiscriminatory Distribution of Funds
e. Fair Labor Practices and Highly Skilled Workforce
g. Civil Rights and Nondiscrimination Law Compliance
h. Climate Resilience

2. Subgrantee Obligations
a. Network Capabilities
b. Deployment Requirements
c. Service Obligations

**1.** **Eligible Entity Obligations**

**a.** **Consider All Provider Types**

Competition among broadband providers has the potential to offer consumers more affordable,
high-quality options for broadband service. As required by the Infrastructure Act, in awarding
subgrants for the deployment of a broadband network using grant funds, Eligible Entities may

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 50

not exclude cooperatives, nonprofit organizations, public-private partnerships, private
companies, public or private utilities, public utility districts, or local governments (“potential
providers”) from eligibility for grant funds. In determining whether to approve an Eligible
Entity’s Initial or Final Proposal, NTIA will consider whether the Eligible Entity has, after the
enactment of the Infrastructure Act, adopted new laws, regulations, policies, procedures or any
other form of rule or restriction that, in the determination of NTIA, seeks to exclude or has the
effect of excluding any potential providers from eligibility for its subgrant competition. This
could include new laws that have the effect of excluding providers from offering broadband
service or rendering them incapable of effectively competing for subgrants.

Some laws of Eligible Entities concerning broadband, utility services, or similar subjects that
*predate* the enactment of the Infrastructure Act may either preclude certain public sector
providers from participation in the subgrant competition or may impose specific requirements on
public sector entities, such as limitations on the sources of financing, the required imputation of
costs not actually incurred by the public sector entity, or restrictions on the service a public
sector entity can offer. NTIA strongly encourages Eligible Entities to waive all such laws for
purposes of the Program. If an Eligible Entity does not do so, the Eligible Entity must identify all
such laws in its Initial Proposal and describe how the laws will be applied in connection with the
competition for subgrants. Such Eligible Entity must, in its Final Proposal, disclose each
unsuccessful application affected by such laws and describe how those laws impacted the
decision to deny the application.

**b.** **Ensure Subgrantee Accountability**

In addition to demonstrating how it expects to satisfy the subrecipient monitoring and
management requirements identified in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 Subpart D, each Eligible Entity must
include sufficient accountability procedures within its program to ensure subgrantee compliance
with all applicable Program requirements. Each Eligible Entity must, at a minimum, include in
any subgrant agreement reasonable provisions allowing for recovery of funds in the event of a
subgrantee’s noncompliance with the BEAD Program’s requirements, including but not limited
to failure to deploy network infrastructure in accordance with mandated deadlines. Each Eligible
Entity must, at a minimum, employ the following practices: (1) distribution of funding to
subgrantees for, at a minimum, all deployment projects on a reimbursable basis (which would
allow the Eligible Entity to withhold funds if the subgrantee fails to take the actions the funds are
meant to subsidize); (2) the inclusion of clawback provisions ( *i.e.*, provisions allowing
recoupment of funds previously disbursed) in agreements between the Eligible Entity and any
subgrantee; (3) timely subgrantee reporting mandates; and (4) robust subgrantee monitoring
practices. NTIA will review proposed subgrant processes during the Initial Proposal and Final
Proposal review phases and will reject Proposals that fail to provide sufficient recourse against
subgrantees that do not fulfill their legal and contractual responsibilities. NTIA likewise will
pursue clawback of funds directly from Eligible Entities that fail to ensure subgrantee
accountability to the fullest extent of the law.

**c.** **Local Coordination**

Each Eligible Entity must develop a comprehensive local coordination approach that will begin
in the development of the Five-Year Action Plan and continue at each stage of the BEAD

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 51

Program through the awarding of all subgrant funding. Local and Tribal coordination and
stakeholder engagement is critical to the BEAD Program’s success, to eliminating barriers to
broadband access and adoption, and to rapidly and economically building out new broadband
networks. NTIA views strong involvement between Eligible Entities and local and Tribal
communities as key to ensuring that the broadband needs of all unserved and underserved
locations and underrepresented communities are accounted for in Initial and Final Plans. Local
coordination promotes alignment of priorities between Eligible Entity and local and Tribal
officials and helps ensure visibility of local needs and preferences. Robust engagement efforts
increase initial adoption rates once the broadband is deployed in an area and stimulate awareness
about the programs that can support the local community.

Accordingly, each Eligible Entity is required to coordinate with political subdivisions, Tribal
Governments, local and community-based organizations, and unions and worker organizations
within its territory to ensure full representation and inclusion of unserved, underserved, and
underrepresented communities throughout the planning and deployment processes. Each Eligible
Entity must document its local coordination and outreach activities by providing a detailed
description of their efforts to engage local governments, community groups, union and worker
organizations, Tribal Governments, and underrepresented populations in its Five-Year Action
Plan, Initial Proposal, and Final Proposal, relative to each stage in the BEAD Program process.
Each Eligible Entity is strongly encouraged to integrate its local coordination efforts with any
outreach and coordination efforts it is required to undertake pursuant to the Digital Equity Act *.*
*See* Section V of this NOFO for additional information concerning application materials.

In evaluating whether local coordination and outreach efforts meet the programmatic
requirements, the Assistant Secretary will assess whether plans and activities undertaken ensure:
(1) full geographic coverage of the Eligible Entity; (2) meaningful engagement and outreach to
diverse stakeholder groups, labor organizations, and community organizations, including to
promote the recruitment of women and other historically marginalized populations for workforce
development opportunities and jobs related to BEAD-funded eligible activities; (3) utilization of
multiple awareness and participation mechanisms and different methods to convey information
and outreach; (4) transparency of processes, to include the documentation and publication of
results and outcomes of such coordination and outreach efforts, including additions or changes to
the Eligible Entity’s Initial Proposal and/or Final Proposal; and (5) outreach to and direct
engagement of unserved and underserved communities to include historically underrepresented
and marginalized groups and/or communities. These requirements are designed to allow Eligible
Entities to tailor the program for the unique environments within its boundaries. In evaluating the
sufficiency of local coordination efforts, the Assistant Secretary will consider quantitative
measures as well as the quality of the engagements.

The requirements of this section are critical to ensuring that Eligible Entities are coordinating
with all communities, including their marginalized and underrepresented populations. Broadband
availability, or lack thereof, is not new to localities and in many instances, they have undertaken
data collection, planning and outreach and engagement efforts to identify the specific and unique
needs of their communities. Bringing these stakeholders to the table will not only result in
Eligible Entities developing and implementing a successful broadband plan that carries out the
intent of the Infrastructure Act, but fosters buy-in from the people the plan and these programs

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 52

are meant to serve. It also builds stronger relationships between Eligible Entities and localities
and creates opportunities for them to further coordinate with each other. Eligible Entities should
track all engagement efforts they conduct and provide a synopsis of the needs identified and if
they were addressed (or not) in the appropriate portions of their Initial Proposals, Final
Proposals, and reporting to NTIA.

**i.** **Geographic Coverage**

Each Eligible Entity must demonstrate that its engagement with its political subdivisions and
applicable Tribal Governments include sufficient geographic granularity to demonstrate full
participation within the Eligible Entity. Engagement must include Tribal, rural, suburban, and
urban areas to the extent applicable in the Eligible Entity and must address diverse stakeholder
groups. Each political subdivision and federally recognized Tribe must be given an opportunity
to submit its own plan [71] to the Eligible Entity for consideration in the development of the
Eligible Entity’s Proposals. Likewise, each political subdivision and federally recognized Tribe
must be given an opportunity to comment on the Proposals of the Eligible Entity before
submission to the Assistant Secretary. The Eligible Entity must detail how it addressed each
submitted plan in each relevant Proposal.

**ii.** **Diverse stakeholder groups**

Throughout its local coordination and outreach activities, each Eligible Entity must ensure that a
diverse set of stakeholders is involved in development of its Five-Year Action Plan, Initial
Proposal, and Final Proposal. To the extent the Eligible Entity encompasses sovereign Tribal or
Native entities, the Eligible Entity must ensure that such entities are involved in development of
the Eligible Entity’s plans, including, but not limited to a formal Tribal consultation process with
the Eligible Entity. In addition, Eligible Entities must coordinate with local stakeholders—such
as entities that carry out workforce development programs and labor unions—to provide a
written explanation of their approach to ensuring a reliable supply of skilled workers, eliciting
feedback on plans for creating good-paying jobs, and to recruiting and hiring women and other
historically marginalized groups for the job opportunities created through the BEAD program.
Other examples of stakeholder groups for consideration include but are not limited to the
following:

State and Territorial agencies, including departments and offices charged with overseeing
transportation, economic development, community development, education, information
technology, health and human services, labor, agriculture, and natural resources; County and
municipal governments and regional associations of governments;

Tribal Governments, Alaska Native entities, and Native Hawaiian organizations;

Community anchor institutions;

Nonprofit and community-based organizations;

Civil rights organizations;

Labor organizations and unions;

71 Plans in this context refer to formal, local broadband plans addressing deployment, equity, or other
issues relevant to the BEAD program goals.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 53

Entities that carry out workforce development programs, including labor-management
partnership training programs (like Registered Apprenticeship programs and preapprenticeships tied to Registered Apprenticeships);

Higher education institutions, including community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Minority-Serving
Institutions (MSIs);

Local educational agencies;

Eligible Entity agencies that are responsible for administering or supervising adult education
and literacy activities in the Eligible Entity;

Public housing authorities or owners/operators of HUD-assisted housing in the Eligible
Entity;

Organizations that represent:

–
Individuals with disabilities, including organizations that represent children with
disabilities;

–
Individuals who are 60 years of age or older;

–
Individuals with language barriers, including English learners and individuals with low
levels of literacy;

–
People of color;

–
LGBTQI+ people;

–
Immigrants;

–
Veterans; and

–
Individuals in that Eligible Entity who are incarcerated;

Economic development organizations, local businesses/chambers of commerce, including
small and disadvantaged businesses and chambers of commerce ( *e.g.*, chambers of commerce
serving underrepresented groups);

Internet Service Providers (ISPs) of all types;

Public Utility Commissions (PUCs) and equivalents;

Consumer advocates and advocacy groups;

Faith-based organizations;

Neighborhood associations; and

Other organizations that serve as representatives of underrepresented communities.

**iii.** **Awareness, Outreach and Participation Mechanisms**

Successful coordination requires multiple mechanisms to ensure broad awareness and
participation. Each Eligible Entity must design and implement efforts that promote inclusivity.
This should be accomplished through facilitating broad outreach efforts that promote
engagement in different ways to ensure that all unserved, underserved and underrepresented
communities are included. Examples of such methods include but are not limited to:

1. Listening sessions, or public meetings (in-person within the community and virtual);

2. Eligible Entity websites and/or email address to submit comments directly;

3. Informational materials such as fact sheets, brochures, Frequently Asked Questions, and
newsletters;

4. Social media (blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, *etc* .);

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 54

5. Email notifications and use of traditional mail;

6. Utilization of community anchor institutions to help promote and distribute information);
and

7. Local Advertisements and Public Service Announcements.

**iv.** **Transparency**

In conducting local coordination and outreach activities, Eligible Entities must establish,
document, and adhere to clear procedures to ensure transparency. This includes publicly posting
the Proposals prior to submission to NTIA as well as plans or comments submitted by local
political subdivisions or Tribal Governments and explanations of how local recommendations
were addressed. Examples of ways to promote and document transparency include but are not
limited to publicly available information and easily navigable websites with up-to-date
information, periodic reporting/reports to local and community stakeholders, and involvement of
diverse stakeholders in the planning, implementation and execution of coordination and outreach
efforts and activities, and in-person meetings and mailings.

**v.** **Underrepresented Engagement**

Specific engagement efforts must be targeted at underrepresented communities within the
Eligible Entity. Underrepresented communities have historically faced barriers in participating in
federal programs and therefore Eligible Entities must identify these communities and determine
specific outreach and engagement strategies tailored to their needs, including providing outreach
in the languages used in the communities these eligible activities serve. Examples of activities
that might be used to reach unserved, underserved, and underrepresented communities include
but are not limited to:

1. The creation of an Eligible Entity-wide task force or advisory board with representatives
from underrepresented communities;

2. Frequent engagement with State, Territorial, county, Tribal, and municipal associations
that may have a greater reach to these communities through their local elected official
members;

3. Engagement with other Eligible Entity departments or agencies that regularly serve these
communities and can help identify and engage with them, such as Eligible Entity
departments of education, health and human services, workforce development, and/or
public health;

4. Utilization of the mechanisms listed in Section IV.C.1.c.iii that demonstrates a targeted
focus on the above identified communities; and

5. Investment in surveys, data collection, and mapping initiatives to better understand gaps
in connectivity and needs.

Each Eligible Entity should combine multiple strategies to develop a comprehensive approach
that ensures equitable and broad participation from all stakeholders. Each Eligible Entity also
must document, publish and integrate its local coordination activities with the outreach and
coordination efforts it will undertake pursuant to the Digital Equity Act *.* It is strongly

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 55

recommended that Eligible Entities conduct BEAD and Digital Equity Act program local
coordination efforts in tandem as one cohesive effort.

**d.** **Equitable and Nondiscriminatory Distribution of Funds**

Consistent with Section 60102(g)(2)(C) of the Infrastructure Act, Eligible Entities must
distribute funds in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner and ensure, through stipulations in
any subgrantee contracts, that each subgrantee uses the funds in an equitable and
nondiscriminatory manner.

**e.** **Fair** **Labor** **Practices and Highly Skilled Workforce**

As set forth above in Section IV.B.7, Eligible Entities must give priority to projects based on
(among other things) a demonstrated record of and plans to be in compliance with federal labor
and employment laws. Eligible Entities are required to give preferential weight to projects based
on the strength of the showing in their application on this factor. Doing so will help ensure that
projects are carried out in accordance with the law, assist Eligible Entities in ensuring that a
prospective subgrantee is capable of carrying out activities funded by a subgrant in a competent
manner in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws, and promote the effective
and efficient completion of high-quality broadband infrastructure projects by ensuring a reliable
supply of skilled workers and minimizing disruptive and costly delays.

Evaluation of a prospective subgrantee’s demonstrated record of and plans to be in compliance
with federal labor and employment laws requires focus on several components. First, Eligible
Entities must obtain and evaluate information on the prospective subgrantee’s record of
compliance with federal labor and employment laws, as well as the records of any other entities
that will participate in the project, including contractors and subcontractors. This information
must include, at a minimum, information on these entities’ compliance with federal labor and
employment laws on broadband deployment projects in the last three years. For example, the
Eligible Entity should collect data on a prospective subgrantee’s historical use of contracting and
subcontracting arrangements, including staffing plans, and at least one example of each
contractor and subcontractor’s past performance in the context of a similar project. Eligible
Entities will be required to describe in their Initial and Final Proposals what specific information
they will require prospective subgrantees to provide in their applications and how they will
weight that information in their competitive selection process. This should include, but not be
limited to, (1) a certification from an Officer/Director-level employee (or equivalent) of the
prospective subgrantee evidencing consistent past compliance with federal labor and
employment laws by the subgrantee, as well as all contractors and subcontractors, and (2) written
confirmation that the prospective subgrantee discloses any instances in which it or its contractors
or subcontractors have been found to have violated laws such as the Occupational Safety and
Health Act, the Fair Labor Standards Act, or any other applicable labor and employment laws for
the preceding three years.

Second, Eligible Entities must require submission of, and evaluate, the prospective subgrantee’s
plans for ensuring compliance with Federal labor and employment laws. These plans must
address, at a minimum, how the prospective subgrantee will ensure compliance in its own labor
and employment practices, as well as that of its contractors and subcontractors, including (1)

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 56

information on applicable wage scales and wage and overtime payment practices for each class
of employees expected to be involved directly in the physical construction of the broadband
network and (2) how the subgrantee will ensure the implementation of workplace safety
committees that are authorized to raise health and safety concerns in connection with the delivery
of deployment projects. Eligible Entities will be required to describe in their Initial and Final
Proposals what specific information they will require prospective subgrantees to provide in their
applications and how they will weight that information in their competitive selection processes.

An effective plan for compliance with federal labor and employment laws can include a
subgrantee’s binding commitment to strong labor standards and protections for the project
workforce (including contractors and subcontractors), which include:

  - Using a directly employed workforce, as opposed to a subcontracted workforce;

  - Paying prevailing wages and benefits to workers, including compliance with DavisBacon and Service Contract Act requirements, where applicable, and collecting the
required certified payrolls;

  - Using project labor agreements ( *i.e.*, pre-hire collective bargaining agreements between
unions and contractors that govern terms and conditions of employment for all workers
on a construction project);

  - Use of local hire provisions;

  - Commitments to union neutrality;

  - Use of labor peace agreements; [72]

  - Use of an appropriately skilled workforce, *e.g.*, through Registered Apprenticeships or
other joint labor-management training programs that serve all workers, particularly those
underrepresented or historically excluded);

  - Use of an appropriately credentialed workforce ( *i.e.*, satisfying requirements for
appropriate and relevant pre-existing occupational training, certification, and licensure);
and

  - Taking steps to prevent the misclassification of workers.

If an Eligible Entity includes any of these as mandatory requirements for all subgrantees
(including contractors and subcontractors), it should describe these requirements in detail its
Initial and Final Proposal and explain how it will incorporate them as binding legal commitments
in the subgrants it makes. An Eligible Entity taking this approach can reduce the showing that
prospective subgrantees need to make in their applications regarding their plans to comply with
federal labor and employment laws.

72 Ability to require labor peace agreements:

  - By a governmental entity: Where a governmental entity receives NTIA grant funds, whether
directly as an Eligible Entity or as a subgrantee, and the governmental entity uses those funds for
the construction of facilities over which it will maintain a proprietary interest ( *e.g.*, governmental
ownership of the network), it is authorized and encouraged to require labor peace agreements,
unless prohibited by state or local law.

  - By a non-governmental subgrantee: Subgrantees that are non-governmental entities, and construct
broadband facilities over which no governmental entity maintains a proprietary interest, are
authorized and encouraged to require labor peace agreements, unless prohibited by state or local
law.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 57

To ensure that subgrantees have the technical and operational capacity to carry out the subgrant,
prospective subgrantees must have a plan for ensuring that the project workforce will be an
appropriately skilled and credentialed workforce (including by the subgrantee and each of its
contractors and subcontractors). For purposes of this section, the “project workforce” includes
those employees of the subgrantee, its contractors, or subcontractors directly engaged in the
physical construction of the broadband network. The plan for a highly skilled workforce should
include the following information:

  - The ways in which the subgrantee will ensure the use of an appropriately skilled
workforce, *e.g.*, through Registered Apprenticeships or other joint labor-management
training programs that serve all workers;

  - The steps that will be taken to ensure that all members of the project workforce will have
appropriate credentials, *e.g.*, appropriate and relevant pre-existing occupational training,
certification, and licensure;

  - Whether the workforce is unionized;

  - Whether the workforce will be directly employed or whether work will be performed by a
subcontracted workforce; and

  - The entities that the proposed subgrantee plans to contract and subcontract with in
carrying out the proposed work.

If the project workforce or any subgrantee’s, contractor’s, or subcontractor’s workforce is not
unionized, the subgrantee must also provide with respect to the non-union workforce:

  - The job titles and size of the workforce (FTE positions, including for contractors and
subcontractors) required to carry out the proposed work over the course of the project and
the entity that will employ each portion of the workforce;

  - For each job title required to carry out the proposed work (including contractors and
subcontractors), a description of:

`o` safety training, certification, and/or licensure requirements ( *e.g.*, OSHA 10,
OSHA 30, confined space, traffic control, or other training as relevant depending
on title and work), including whether there is a robust in-house training program
with established requirements tied to certifications, titles; and
`o` information on the professional certifications and/or in-house training in place to
ensure that deployment is done at a high standard.

**f.** **Advancing Equitable Workforce Development and Job Quality**
**Objectives**

A skilled workforce is critical to meeting infrastructure buildout timelines under the
Infrastructure Act and connecting households across the country to reliable, affordable, highspeed broadband. A highly skilled workforce will also allow for the safe deployment of
sustainable networks. To meet the workforce needs of this program, Eligible Entities and their
subgrantees should make appropriate investments to develop a skilled, diverse workforce for the
jobs that the subgrantees need to fill. [73]

73 Workforce development programs that provide high-skilled workers that support BEAD-funded
projects are an eligible use of grant funds. *See* Section V.K for eligible uses.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 58

**i. Requirements.** Eligible Entities are required to include in their Initial and Final Proposals:

1. A description of how the Eligible Entity will ensure that subgrantees support the
development and use of a highly skilled workforce capable of carrying out work in a
manner that is safe and effective.

2. A description of how the Eligible Entity will develop and promote sector-based
partnerships among employers, education and training providers, the public workforce
system, unions and worker organizations, and community-based organizations that
provide relevant training (including through Registered Apprenticeships and preapprenticeships that are integrated with Registered Apprenticeships, or other quality
work-based learning programs) and provide wrap-around services to support workers to
access and complete training (such as child care, transportation, mentorship, *etc.* ), to
attract, train, retain, or transition to meet local workforce needs and increase high-quality
job opportunities. [74]

3. A description of how the Eligible Entity will plan to create equitable on-ramps into
broadband-related jobs ( *e.g.*, how entities plan to engage or partner with stakeholders like
State, Territorial, and local workforce boards, training partners, labor and community
organizations); maintain job quality for new and incumbent workers engaged in the
sector; and continually engage with labor organizations and community-based
organizations to maintain worker voice throughout the planning and implementation

process;

4. A description of how the Eligible Entity will ensure that the job opportunities created by
the BEAD Program and other broadband funding programs are available to a diverse pool
of workers, including by engaging in targeted outreach, and seek subgrantees with
effective plans for outreach, to populations that have traditionally been underrepresented
in broadband and information technology jobs, including but not limited to women and
people of color. Eligible Entities should be prepared to report on the demographics of
each subgrantee workforce that is engaged on a project or other eligible activity utilizing
BEAD grant funding (this will be aggregate workforce data only, not personally
identifiable information), and should expect that this data will be made public.

**ii. Other Considerations.** NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to consider workforce
development goals when selecting subgrantees. This could include setting requirements
applicable to all subgrantees or establishing scoring factors. Eligible Entities can accomplish this
in various ways, including the following:

1. Ensuring that subgrantees require their contractors and subcontractors to provide
Registered Apprenticeships and pre-apprenticeships tied to a Registered Apprenticeship,
joint labor management partnerships, and other high-quality, on-the-job training
opportunities, which may include minimum requirements of contractor or subcontractor
job hours to be performed by apprentices; and ensuring that such programs lead to

74 For additional information on sector-based partnerships, Eligible Entities should review the Economic
Development Administration’s Good Jobs Challenge NOFO, EDA-HDQ-ARPGJ-2021-2006964,

employment with wages at rates not less than the rates prevailing on projects and other
eligible activities of a similar character in the locality as determined by the Secretary of
Labor in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.

2. Ensuring that subgrantees offer “quality” jobs. [75] For example, an Eligible Entity should
consider scoring applicants based in part on the extent to which they will deliver on the
quality jobs standard.

3. Ensuring that subgrantees prioritize hiring local workers and have robust and specific
plans to recruit historically underrepresented populations facing labor market barriers and
ensure that they have reasonable access to the job opportunities created by subgrantees.
Such populations may include communities of color, women, and other groups (such as
persons with disabilities, LGBTQI+ people, disconnected youth, individuals in recovery,
individuals with past criminal records, including justice-impacted and reentry
participants, serving trainees participating in the SNAP, TANF, and WIC, and veterans
and military spouses).

**g.** **Civil Rights and Nondiscrimination Law Compliance**

No person in the United States may, on the ground of actual or perceived race, color, national
origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or handicap, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under, any program or
activity receiving federal financial assistance. Prior to distributing any BEAD funding to a
subgrantee, an Eligible Entity must require the subgrantee to agree, by contract or other binding
commitment, to abide by the non-discrimination requirements set forth in the following legal
authorities, to the extent applicable, and to acknowledge that failure to do so may result in
cancellation of any award and/or recoupment of funds already disbursed:

1. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000d *et seq* .) and the Department
of Commerce’s implementing regulations, published at 15 C.F.R. Part 8, which prohibit
discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or national origin under programs or activities
receiving federal financial assistance;

2. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 *et seq* .) which
prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex under federally assisted education programs or
activities;

3. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 *et seq* .) which prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability under programs, activities, and services provided or
made available by Eligible Entity and local governments or instrumentalities or agencies
thereto, as well as public or private entities that provide public transportation;

75 A “quality job” is defined as a job that (1) exceeds the local prevailing wage for an industry in the
region, includes basic benefits ( *e.g.*, paid leave, health insurance, retirement/savings plan), and/or is
unionized, and (2) helps the employee develop the skills and experiences necessary to advance along a
career path. *See* Economic Development Administration *,* ARPA Good Jobs Challenge NOFO, EDAHDQ-ARPGJ-2021-2006964, at n. 1, *available at* [https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=334720) [opportunity.html?oppId](https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=334720) = 334720.

4. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. § 794), and
Department of Commerce implementing regulations published at 15 C.F.R. Part 8b, which
prohibit discrimination on the basis of handicap under any program or activity receiving or
benefiting from federal assistance;

5. The Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as amended (42 U.S.C. §§ 6101 *et seq* .), and
Department of Commerce implementing regulations published at 15 C.F.R. Part 20, which
prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving federal
financial assistance;

6. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e *et seq* ., which provides that
it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discharge any individual or
otherwise to discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation, terms,
conditions, or privileges of employment because of such individual’s race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin. Note in this regard that Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-1(a), expressly
exempts from the prohibition against discrimination based on religion “a religious
corporation, association, educational institution, or society with respect to the employment of
individuals of a particular religion to perform work connected with the carrying on by such
corporation, association, educational institution, or society of its activities;” and

7. Any other applicable non-discrimination law(s). Application requirements, award terms,
and conditions do not impose civil rights and nondiscrimination law compliance
requirements on Indian Tribes or Native Entities beyond what would otherwise apply under
federal law.

In addition, each Eligible Entity must demonstrate in its Initial Proposal and Final Proposal that
its selection of subgrantees will account for and satisfy the following authorities:

1. Parts II and III of Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity (30 Fed. Reg.
12319), which requires that federally assisted construction contracts incorporate and fulfill
the nondiscrimination provisions of §§ 202 and 203 of E.O. 11246 and Department of Labor
regulations implementing E.O. 11246 (41 C.F.R. § 60-1.4(b)). [76]

2. Executive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English
Proficiency (65 Fed. Reg. 50121), which requires federal agencies to examine the services
that they provide, identify any need for services to those with limited English proficiency
(LEP), and develop and implement a system to provide those services so LEP persons can
have meaningful access to them. Note that the Department of Commerce issued policy
guidance on March 24, 2003 (68 Fed. Reg. 14180) to articulate the Title VI prohibition
against national origin discrimination affecting LEP persons and to help ensure that nonfederal entities provide meaningful access to their LEP applicants and beneficiaries.

3. Executive Order 13798, Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty, and Office of
Management and Budget, M-20-09—Guidance Regarding Federal Grants and Executive

76 Among other things, entities undertaking either wholly or partially federally funded construction
projects may not “discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color,
religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin,” and must “take affirmative action to
ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to
their race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.” Executive Order

Order 13798 (January 16, 2020), which provide that States or other public grantees may not
condition sub-awards of federal grant money in a manner that would disadvantage grant
applicants based on their religious character.

**h.** **Climate Resilience**

In establishing their Initial Proposals and Final Proposals, Eligible Entities must demonstrate that
they have sufficiently accounted for current and future weather- and climate-related risks to new
infrastructure projects. At present, weather- and climate-related risks to broadband networks
include wildfires, extreme heat and cold, inland and coastal flooding, and the extreme winds
produced by weather events such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and other weather events. Because
retrofitted and new infrastructure for broadband might be expected to have a lifetime of 20 years
or more, Eligible Entities must account not only for current risks but also for how the frequency,
severity, and nature of these extreme events may plausibly evolve as our climate continues to
change over the coming decades. Future projected climate change is expected to continue to
result in higher seasonal temperatures and an increased likelihood of extreme heat events, higher
risk of wildfires, more intense rainfall events, sea level rise and coastal inundation, permafrost
thaw in Alaska, and the potential for stronger hurricanes when they do form, and other climate
change related impacts. [77]

Communities that lack broadband are also often the most vulnerable to extreme weather and

climate events. This combination often results in a lack of crucial communications infrastructure
to respond during these emergencies. Building climate-resilient broadband infrastructure for such
communities provides emergency response preparedness and thus greater climate resilience for
the community itself.

In light of the above, Eligible Entities should make use of available tools and resources from the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal agencies, as well
as Eligible Entity-level resources and centers of expertise, in drawing up their Proposals pursuant
to the BEAD Program. Each Eligible Entity must explain in its Initial and Final Proposal how it
has utilized these tools and resources to account for, mitigate, and where possible, avoid the
known and identifiable risks of current and future projected weather and climate conditions.
Eligible Entities also should explain how they addressed these risks through measures such as
(but not necessarily limited to) choice of a technology platform suitable to the climate risks of
the region, reliance on alternative siting of facilities ( *e.g.*, underground construction where
appropriate), retrofitting or hardening of existing assets that are critical to BEAD-funded
offerings, additional onsite and in-home power resources, use of established plans and processes
to deal with extreme weather related risks, the speed of restoration of service in the case of an
outage, and use of network and facility redundancies to safeguard against threats to
infrastructure. In particular, in its Initial Proposal and Final Proposal, each Eligible Entity
should, at a minimum, clearly do each of the following:

77 For example, in accordance with Section 2(a)(1) of Executive Order 11988, as amended by Executive
Order 13690, before taking an action, the applicant, in coordination with NTIA, must determine whether a
proposed action will occur in a floodplain.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 62

1. Identify the geographic areas that should be subject to an initial hazard screening for
current and future weather- and climate-related risks and the time scales for performing such
screenings;

2. Identify which weather and climate hazards may be most important to account for and
respond to in these areas and over the relevant time horizons, utilizing the tools and resources
recommended below or other resources available to the Eligible Entity;

3. Characterize any weather and climate risks to new infrastructure deployed using BEAD
Program funds for the 20 years following deployment;

4. Identify how the proposed plan will avoid and/or mitigate the weather and climate risks
identified; and

5. Detail the Eligible Entity’s plans for periodically repeating this process over the life of the
Program to ensure that evolving risks are understood, characterized and addressed, and that
the most up-to-date tools and information resources are utilized.

For flooding hazards, the Eligible Entity should take into account the Federal Flood Risk
Management Standard and Implementing Guidelines established through in Executive Order
14030, *Climate-Related Financial Risk* (86 FR 27967) and Executive Order 13690, *Establishing*
*a Federal Flood Risk Management Standard and a Process for Further Soliciting and*

**2.** **Obligations for Subgrantees Deploying Network Projects**

**a.** **Network Capabilities**

Eligible Entities shall ensure that any subgrant agreement for a Funded Network permits the
subgrantee to use the subgrant to deploy broadband infrastructure in or through any area required
to reach interconnection points or otherwise to ensure the technical feasibility and financial
sustainability of a project providing broadband service to an unserved location, underserved
location, or Eligible Community Anchor Institution.

Pursuant to Section 60102(g)(1)(A) of the Infrastructure Act, which directs the Assistant
Secretary to establish quality-of-service standards to which each subgrantee must comply, each
Eligible Entity shall ensure that every Funded Network meets the following criteria:

**i.** **Speed and Latency**

To ensure that Funded Networks meet current and future use cases and to promote consistency
across federal agencies, NTIA adopts the compliance standards and testing protocols for speed
and latency established and used by the Commission in multiple contexts, including the Connect
America Fund and the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund. [78] In order to demonstrate continued
compliance with these standards, subgrantees must perform speed and latency tests from the
customer premises of an active subscriber to a remote test server at an end-point consistent with
the requirements for a Commission-designated IXP. [79]

Subject to the exceptions identified in Section IV.B.7.a, Funded Networks shall deliver Reliable
Broadband Service with speeds of not less than 100 Mbps for downloads and 20 Mbps for

78 *See, e.g.,* *Connect America Fund*, WC Docket No. 10-90, Order, 33 FCC Rcd 6509 (WCB/WTB/OET

No. 10-90, 34 FCC Rcd 10109 (2019) ( *Performance Measures Reconsideration Order* ).

79 *See* *Performance Measures Reconsideration Order*, 34 FCC Rcd at 10114-16, paras. 17-19.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 64

uploads. [80] In addition, 95 percent of latency measurements during testing windows must fall at
or below 100 milliseconds round-trip time. [81] This approach ensures a connection that supports
reasonably foreseeable real-time applications. In the limited circumstance where even a fiber
deployment cannot achieve this latency threshold (for example in a remote territory), NTIA may
expand the latency threshold for specific Funded Networks at the request of an Eligible Entity.

Funded Network connections to Eligible Community Anchor Institutions shall be capable of
delivering service at speeds not less than 1 Gigabit per second for downloads and 1 Gigabit per
second for uploads. [82] Eligible Entities shall ensure that such connections can be used to provide
business data services. [83]

**ii.** **Network Outages**

Each Funded Network’s outages should not exceed, on average, 48 hours over any 365-day
period except in the case of natural disasters or other force majeure occurrence. Each Eligible
Entity should ensure a prospective network is designed to meet this requirement and should
develop metrics for measuring outages to be utilized in connection with this requirement once
the network is operational.

**b.** **Deployment Requirements**

**i.** **Deployment Deadlines and Benchmarks**

Eligible Entities shall ensure that each subgrantee deploys its Funded Networks and begins
providing broadband service to each customer that desires broadband service not later than four
years after the date on which the subgrantee receives the subgrant for the applicable network. [84]
Eligible Entities shall establish interim buildout milestones, enforceable as conditions of the
subgrant, sufficient to ensure that subgrantees are making reasonable progress toward meeting
the four-year deployment deadline. Eligible Entities may, following consultation with the NTIA
and with the approval of the Assistant Secretary, extend the deadlines under this subparagraph if
the Eligible Entity reasonably determines that (i) the subgrantee has a specific plan for use of the
grant funds, with project completion expected by a specific date not more than one year after the
four-year deadline; (ii) the construction project is underway; or (iii) extenuating circumstances
require an extension of time to allow the project to be completed.

80 80 percent of a provider’s download and upload measurements must be at or above 80 percent of the
required speed ( *i.e.*, an 80/80 standard). *See Performance Measures Order*, 34 FCC Rcd at 6528, para. 51.

81 *See id.*, 34 FCC Rcd at 6527-28, para. 50.

82 These requirements are consistent with § 60401(e)(3)(C) of the Infrastructure Act.

83 The term “business data service” refers to the dedicated point-to-point transmission of data at certain
guaranteed speeds and service levels using high-capacity connections. *See Business Data Services in an*
*Internet Protocol Environment et al.*, WC Docket No. 16-143 *et al* ., Report and Order, 32 FCC Rcd 3459,
3463 para. 6 (2017).

84 As detailed below, each subgrantee that uses BEAD Funding to undertake a broadband infrastructure
deployment project has a continuing obligation to provide access to broadband service to each customer
served by the project that desires such service on terms and conditions that are reasonable and nondiscriminatory. *See* Section IV.C.2.c.iii of this NOFO.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 65

**ii.** **Conduit Access Points**

Any Funded Network deployment project that involves laying fiber-optic cables or conduit
underground or along a roadway must include interspersed conduit access points at regular and
short intervals for interconnection by unaffiliated entities. Where a project proposes to lay
conduit, Eligible Entities shall require prospective subgrantees to propose to deploy a reasonable
amount of excess conduit capacity and to propose a conduit access point interval as part of the
grant application process and shall consider the adequacy of the prospective subgrantee’s
proposed excess conduit capacity and access points when evaluating the application.

**c.** **Service Obligations**

**i.** **Affordability and Low-Cost Plans**

The Infrastructure Act’s BEAD provisions are premised on Congress’s determination that
“[a]ccess to affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband is essential to full participation in modern
life in the United States,” and that “[t]he persistent ‘digital divide’ in the United States is a
barrier to” the nation’s “economic competitiveness [and the] equitable distribution of essential
public services, including health care and education.” [85] Accordingly, each Eligible Entity must
include in its Initial and Final Proposals a middle-class affordability plan to ensure that *all*
consumers have access to *affordable* high-speed internet. We expect that Eligible Entities will
adopt diverse strategies to achieve this objective. For example, some Eligible Entities might
require providers receiving BEAD funds to offer low-cost, high-speed plans to all middle-class
households using the BEAD-funded network. Others might provide consumer subsidies to defray
subscription costs for households not eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Benefit or other
federal subsidies. Others may use their regulatory authority to promote structural competition.
Some might assign especially high weights to selection criteria relating to affordability and/or
open access in selecting BEAD subgrantees. [86] And others might employ a combination of these
methods, or other methods not mentioned here. Ultimately, however, each Eligible Entity must
submit a plan to ensure that high-quality broadband services are available to all middle-class
families in the BEAD-funded network’s service area at reasonable prices. Eligible Entities will
be required to ensure that services offered over Funded Networks allow subscribers in the service
area to utilize the ACP.

In addition, the Infrastructure Act requires that each subgrantee receiving BEAD funding to
deploy network infrastructure offer at least one low-cost broadband service option. Each Eligible
Entity must consult with the Assistant Secretary and prospective subgrantees regarding a
proposed definition of the term “low-cost broadband service option.” Each Eligible Entity shall
thereafter submit a proposed definition to the Assistant Secretary for approval in its Final
Proposal. The Infrastructure Act directs the Assistant Secretary to define the subscribers eligible
for such low-cost plans.

Eligible Entities must propose low-cost broadband service option parameters that best serve the
needs of residents within their jurisdictions. Low-cost broadband service options must remain

85 Infrastructure Act § 60101.

86 *See supra* Section IV.B.7.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 66

available for the useful life of the network assets. In crafting proposals, NTIA emphasizes that
access to *affordable* broadband is among the Infrastructure Act’s objectives. In determining
whether to approve an Eligible Entity’s proposed definition of “low-cost broadband service
option,” the Assistant Secretary will consider, among other factors, (1) whether prospective
subgrantees will be required to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program, any
successor program, and/or any other household broadband subsidy programs; (2) the expected
cost (both monthly and non-recurring charges) to an Eligible Subscriber for a typical broadband
internet access service plan after the application of any subsidies; and (3) the performance
characteristics of the proposed options, including download and upload speeds, latency, data
caps, and reliability commitments.

A definition of low-cost broadband service option should address, at a minimum: (1) all
recurring charges to the subscriber, as well as any non-recurring costs or fees to the subscriber
( *e.g.*, service initiation costs); (2) the plan’s basic service characteristics (download and upload
speeds, latency, any limits on usage or availability, and any material network management
practices, (3) whether a subscriber may use any Affordable Connectivity Benefit subsidy toward
the plan’s rate; and (4) any provisions regarding the subscriber’s ability to upgrade to any new
low-cost service plans offering more advantageous technical specifications. For example, a
definition of low-cost broadband service option could be as follows:

1. The proposed service option:

a. Costs $30 per month or less, inclusive of all taxes, fees, and charges if the
subscriber does not reside on Tribal Lands, or $75 per month or less, inclusive of
all taxes, fees, and charges if the subscriber resides on Tribal Lands, with no
additional non-recurring costs or fees to the consumer;

b. Allows the end user to apply the Affordable Connectivity Benefit subsidy to the
service price;

c. Provides the greater of (a) typical download speeds of at least 100 Mbps and
typical upload speeds of at least 20 Mbps, or the fastest speeds the infrastructure
is capable of if less than 100 Mbps/20 Mbps or (b) the performance benchmark
for fixed terrestrial broadband service established by the Federal Communications
Commission pursuant to Section 706(b) of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended; [87]

d. Provides typical latency measurements of no more than 100 milliseconds; and

e. Is not subject to data caps, surcharges, or usage-based throttling, and is subject
only to the same acceptable use policies to which subscribers to all other
broadband internet access service plans offered to home subscribers by the
participating subgrantee must adhere;

f. In the event the provider later offers a low-cost plan with higher speeds
downstream and/or upstream, permits Eligible Subscribers that are subscribed to a

87 47 U.S.C. § 1302(b). The current performance benchmark for fixed terrestrial broadband service is 25
Mbps for downloads and 3 Mbps for uploads. *See Inquiry Concerning Deployment of Advanced*
*Telecommunications Capability to All Americans in a Reasonable and Timely Fashion*, Fourteenth
Broadband Deployment Report, GN Docket No. 20-269, 36 FCC Rcd 836, 841 para. 12 (2021).

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 67

low-cost broadband service option to upgrade to the new low-cost offering at no
cost; [88]

2. Subgrantees are required to participate in the Affordable Connectivity Program or any
successor program, and Eligible Subscribers that are eligible for a broadband service
subsidy can apply the subsidy to the proposed service option.

NTIA recognizes, however, that different Eligible Entities face different circumstances. NTIA
will review and consider any definition proposed by an Eligible Entity in accordance with the
terms of the BEAD statute. In all cases, an Eligible Entity must explain in its Initial and Final
Proposal why the selected definition best effectuates the purposes of the program. NTIA may
provide additional guidance to Eligible Entities on the development of the low-cost broadband
service option definition.

**ii.** **Consumer Protections**

Each Eligible Entity shall ensure that each prospective subgrantee does not impose data usage
caps on any plans offered over a Funded Network or impose unjust or unreasonable network
management practices. [89] Subgrantees shall certify through the semiannual reporting
requirements described in Section VII.E of this NOFO that the plans offered over Funded
Networks do not contain data usage caps for subscribers.

**iii.** **Access to Service**

Operators of Funded Networks shall provide access to broadband service to each customer
served by the project that desires broadband service on terms and conditions that are reasonable
and non-discriminatory.

**iv.** **Public Notice**

Eligible Entities shall require subgrantees to carry out public awareness campaigns in their
service areas that are designed to highlight the value and benefits of broadband service in order
to increase the adoption of broadband service by consumers. Awareness campaigns must include
information about low-cost service plans and any federal subsidies for low-income households
such as the Lifeline Program, the Affordable Connectivity Program, and any successor programs.
Further, awareness campaigns must be conducted in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner.
Subgrantees must utilize a variety of communications media ( *e.g.*, online, print, radio) and
provide information in languages other than English when warranted based on the demographics
of the community.

Eligible Entities shall require that once a Funded Network has been deployed, each subgrantee
shall provide public notice, online and through other means, of that fact to individuals residing in

88 By way of example, if a customer is subscribed to a low-cost broadband service option that provides
service at 100/20 Mbps and the customer’s service provider offers a new low-cost broadband service
option at 200/20 Mbps after the FCC issues a new report pursuant to section 706(a) of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the customer would be allowed to upgrade to the 200/20
Mbps offering at no charge.

89 Providers may apply otherwise-applicable acceptable use policies to BEAD-funded networks.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 68

the locations to which broadband service has been provided and share the public notice with the
Eligible Entity that awarded the subgrant. Each Eligible Entity shall require each prospective
subgrantee seeking to deploy or upgrade network facilities to explain in its application how it
intends to notify relevant populations of the new or newly upgraded offerings available in each
area. Such proposals shall be designed in a manner that reflects any unique needs of the specific
demographics of the area at issue (including, for example, languages prominently spoken in the
area and the best means of ensuring that the population is likely to encounter the subgrantee’s
public notice).

**v.** **Interconnection Requirements and Wholesale Access**

Any subgrantee receiving funds to deploy Middle Mile Infrastructure under this Program in
connection with service to an Unserved Service Project or an Underserved Service Project shall
permit other broadband service providers to interconnect with its funded Middle Mile
Infrastructure network facilities on a just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. An Eligible
Entity awarding funds for construction of Middle Mile Infrastructure shall require the
subgrantee, via contract or other binding mandate, to allow such interconnection at any
technically feasible point on the Middle Mile Infrastructure network (without exceeding current
or reasonably anticipated capacity limitations). This duty includes, at a minimum, the physical
interconnection of the subgrantee’s Middle Mile Infrastructure to a requesting party’s facilities
for the exchange of traffic. In addition, subgrantees shall connect to the public internet directly or
indirectly and provide requesting parties with an ability to connect to the internet. Rates and
terms for interconnection shall be reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Each Eligible Entity shall
require each subgrantee that obtains funding for the deployment or upgrade of Middle Mile
Infrastructure to negotiate in good faith with any requesting party (including public, Tribal,
private, non-profit, or other parties) making a bona fide request for interconnection. Subgrantees
shall report through the subgrantee reporting process established in Section VII.E.2 of this
NOFO any interconnection requests made to the subgrantee during that year and the status of
those requests. In selecting subgrantees for last-mile deployments to Unserved Service Projects
and Underserved Service Projects, NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to give preference to
prospective subgrantees who commit to offering wholesale broadband services at rates and terms
that are reasonable and nondiscriminatory.

Eligible Entities shall require that if a subgrantee, at any time, is no longer able to provide
broadband service to the end user locations covered by the subgrant at any time on a retail basis
remedial action be taken to ensure continuity of service. In consultation with NTIA, the Eligible
Entity shall require the subgrantee to sell the network capacity at a reasonable, wholesale rate on
a nondiscriminatory basis to one or more other broadband service providers or public-sector
entities or sell the network in its entirety to a new provider who commits to providing services
under the terms of the BEAD Program. [90] The Eligible Entity may pursue either remedial action
so long as such action results in continued retail service to end users in the grant area.

90 If the subgrantee is no longer viable as a going concern, or if it is unable to provide sustained service
over the network at issue, the Eligible Entity should work with the subgrantee and NTIA to assist in sale
of the assets to a new owner that can assume the original subgrantee’s service and programmatic
responsibilities.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 69

**vi.** **Cybersecurity and Supply Chain Risk Management**

The Infrastructure Act directs the Assistant Secretary to specify prudent cybersecurity and
supply-chain risk management practices for subgrantees deploying or upgrading broadband
networks using BEAD funds. NTIA recognizes the importance of (a) protecting American
communications networks and those who use them from domestic and international threat actors,
and (b) promoting the natural evolution of cybersecurity and supply-chain risk management
practices in a manner that allows flexibility in addressing evolving threats. To that end, we
impose baseline requirements herein, though an Eligible Entity may propose additional measures
it believes necessary to safeguard networks and users falling within its jurisdiction for
consideration by the Assistant Secretary.

With respect to cybersecurity, prior to allocating any funds to a subgrantee, an Eligible Entity
shall, at a minimum, require a prospective subgrantee to attest that:

1. The prospective subgrantee has a cybersecurity risk management plan (the plan) in
place that is either:

a. operational, if the prospective subgrantee is providing service prior to the award of
the grant; or

b. ready to be operationalized upon providing service, if the prospective subgrantee is
not yet providing service prior to the grant award;

2. The plan reflects the latest version of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
(currently Version 1.1) and the standards and controls set forth in Executive Order 14028
and specifies the security and privacy controls being implemented;

3. The plan will be reevaluated and updated on a periodic basis and as events warrant;
and

4. The plan will be submitted to the Eligible Entity prior to the allocation of funds. If the
subgrantee makes any substantive changes to the plan, a new version will be submitted to
the Eligible Entity within 30 days. The Eligible Entity must provide a subgrantee’s plan
to NTIA upon NTIA’s request.

With respect to supply chain risk management (SCRM), prior to allocating any funds to a
subgrantee, an Eligible Entity shall, at a minimum, require a prospective subgrantee to attest that:

1. The prospective subgrantee has a SCRM plan in place that is either:

a. operational, if the prospective subgrantee is already providing service at the time of
the grant; or

b. ready to be operationalized, if the prospective subgrantee is not yet providing
service at the time of grant award;

2. The plan is based upon the key practices discussed in the NIST publication NISTIR
8276, *Key Practices in Cyber Supply Chain Risk Management: Observations from*
*Industry* and related SCRM guidance from NIST, including NIST 800-161, *Cybersecurity*
*Supply Chain Risk Management Practices for Systems and Organizations* and specifies
the supply chain risk management controls being implemented;

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 70

3. The plan will be reevaluated and updated on a periodic basis and as events warrant;
and

4. The plan will be submitted to the Eligible Entity prior to the allocation of funds. If the
subgrantee makes any substantive changes to the plan, a new version will be submitted to
the Eligible Entity within 30 days. The Eligible Entity must provide a subgrantee’s plan
to NTIA upon NTIA’s request

An Eligible Entity also must ensure that, to the extent a BEAD subgrantee relies in whole or in
part on network facilities owned or operated by a third party ( *e.g.*, purchases wholesale carriage
on such facilities), obtain the above attestations from its network provider with respect to both
cybersecurity and supply chain risk management practices.

**D.** **Subgrantee Qualifications**

Eligible Entities shall ensure that any prospective subgrantee is capable of carrying out activities
funded by the subgrant in a competent manner and in compliance with all applicable federal,
State, Territorial, and local laws. Eligible Entities also shall ensure that prospective subgrantees
have the *competence*, *managerial* and *financial* capacity to meet the commitments of the
subgrant and any requirements of the Program, as well as the *technical* and *operational*
capability to provide the services promised in the subgrant in the manner contemplated by the
subgrant award.

Specific showings that Eligible Entities must require from prospective subgrantees seeking to
deploy network facilities using BEAD funds are further detailed in Section IV.D.2. NTIA
acknowledges that prospective subgrantees may be able to, or required, to demonstrate their
capabilities in a variety of manners. A newly established special purpose vehicle established by a
consortium of entities may point to the capabilities and experience of those entities in support of
its application. A prospective subgrantee that has significant experience deploying broadband
networks but no experience operating them may be able to demonstrate operational capability by
entering a binding contract with another entity with such experience. The types of evidence
available to municipal entities seeking to demonstrate financial capability may well differ from
the kinds of evidence expected of commercial enterprises; Eligible Entities should accommodate
these differences in establishing their requirements. The Assistant Secretary invites Eligible
Entities to propose alternatives to the specific showings set forth herein if they are necessary and
sufficient to ensure that the Program’s objectives are met.

**1.** **General Qualifications**

Prior to entering into any subgrantee agreement, each Eligible Entity shall ensure that any
prospective subgrantee:

1. Is capable of carrying out activities funded by the subgrant in a competent manner in
compliance with all applicable federal, Eligible Entity, and local laws;

2. Has the financial and managerial capacity to meet the commitments of the subgrantee
under the subgrant, the requirements of the Program and such other requirements as have
been prescribed by the Assistant Secretary or the Eligible Entity; and

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 71

3. Has the technical and operational capability to provide the services promised in the
subgrant in the manner contemplated by the subgrant award.

Eligible Entities shall, *at a minimum*, take the steps detailed below to evaluate the ability of a
prospective subgrantee to meet the requirements set forth above prior to entering into any
subgrant agreement.

**2.** **Specific Qualifications for Subgrantees Deploying Network Facilities**

**a.** **Financial Capability**

With the exception of the certifications required under Section IV.D.2.a.i below, Eligible Entities
may, with the permission of the Assistant Secretary, allow prospective subgrantees that have the
ability to issue public bonds ( *e.g.*, municipalities) to provide comparable evidence in support of
their financial capabilities. NTIA will provide additional guidance regarding acceptable
comparable evidence after publication of this NOFO.

**i.** **Certifications**

Prospective subgrantees must certify that they are financially qualified to meet the obligations
associated with a Project, that they will have available funds for all project costs that exceed the
amount of the grant, and that they will comply with all Program requirements, including service
milestones. To the extent the Eligible Entity disburses funding to subgrantees only upon
completion of the associated tasks (a practice that NTIA encourages Eligible Entities to adopt, as
described in Section IV.C.1.b of this NOFO), each prospective subgrantee must also certify that
it has and will continue to have sufficient financial resources to cover its eligible costs for the
Project until such time as the Eligible Entity authorizes additional disbursements.

**ii.** **Letter of Credit**

Each Eligible Entity shall establish a model letter of credit substantially similar to the model
letter of credit established by the Commission in connection with the Rural Digital Opportunity
Fund (RDOF). [91]

During the application process, prospective subgrantees shall be required to submit a letter from
a bank that meets eligibility requirements consistent with those set forth in 47 C.F.R.
§ 54.804(c)(2) committing to issue an irrevocable standby letter of credit, in the required form, to
the prospective subgrantee. The letter shall at a minimum provide the dollar amount of the letter
of credit and the issuing bank’s agreement to follow the terms and conditions of the Eligible
Entity’s model letter of credit.

Prior to entering into any subgrantee agreement, each prospective subgrantee shall obtain an
irrevocable standby letter of credit, which shall be acceptable in all respects to the Eligible Entity

91 *Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order*, 35 FCC Rcd at 773-77, Appx. C.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 72

and in a value of no less than 25 percent of the subaward amount. [92] Eligible Entities may adopt
rules under which a subgrantee may obtain a new letter of credit or renew its existing letter of
credit so that it is valued at a lesser amount than originally required by the Eligible Entity upon
verification that the subgrantee has met optional or required service milestones. [93] In no event,
however, shall the letter of credit have a value of less than 25 percent of the subaward amount.

A prospective subgrantee shall provide with its letter of credit an opinion letter from legal
counsel clearly stating, subject only to customary assumptions, limitations, and qualifications,
that in a proceeding under Title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. § 101 *et seq* . (the
“Bankruptcy Code”), the bankruptcy court would not treat the letter of credit or proceeds of the
letter of credit as property of the winning subgrantee’s bankruptcy estate under Section 541 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

**iii.** **Audited Financial Statements**

Each prospective subgrantee shall submit to the Eligible Entity from which it seeks funding
financial statements from the prior fiscal year that are audited by an independent certified public
accountant. If the potential subgrantee has not been audited during the ordinary course of
business, in lieu of submitting audited financial statements, it must submit unaudited financial
statements from the prior fiscal year and certify that it will provide financial statements from the
prior fiscal year that are audited by an independent certified public accountant by a deadline
specified by the Eligible Entity.

An Eligible Entity shall not approve any grant for the deployment or upgrading of network
facilities unless it determines that the documents submitted to it demonstrate the prospective
subgrantee’s financial capability with respect to the proposed project.

**iv.** **Sustainability / Pro Forma Analyses of Proposed**
**Project**

The Eligible Entity shall require prospective subgrantees to submit business plans and related
analyses that substantiate the sustainability of the proposed project. This can be provided in the
form of pro forma statements or analyses, inclusive of cash flow and balance sheet projections
and should include at least three years of operating cost and cash flow projections post targeted
completion of project.

**b.** **Managerial Capability**

Prospective subgrantees shall submit to the Eligible Entity resumes for all key management
personnel and any necessary organizational chart(s) detailing all parent, subsidiaries, and
affiliates. Each prospective subgrantee must also provide a narrative describing the prospective
subgrantee’s readiness to manage a broadband services network. This narrative should describe
the experience and qualifications of key management for undertaking this project, its experience

92 At this step, the subgrantee must obtain an actual letter of credit, in contrast to bank’s commitment to
issue the letter of credit, which is what is required during the application process.

93 *See, e.g.*, 47 C.F.R. § 54.804(c)(1).

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 73

undertaking projects of similar size and scope, recent and upcoming organizational changes
including mergers and acquisitions, and relevant organizational policies. An Eligible Entity shall
not approve any grant for the deployment or upgrading of network facilities unless it determines
that the documents submitted to it demonstrate the prospective subgrantee’s managerial
capability with respect to the proposed project.

Eligible Entities may require a prospective subgrantee to agree to special grant conditions
relating to maintaining the validity of representations a prospective subgrantee has made
regarding its organizational structure and key personnel.

**c.** **Technical Capability**

Each prospective subgrantee seeking funding to deploy or upgrade a broadband network must
certify that it is technically qualified to complete and operate the Project and that it is capable of
carrying out the funded activities in a competent manner, including that it will use an
appropriately skilled and credentialed workforce ( *see* Section IV.C.1.e of this NOFO).

Prospective subgrantees must submit a network design, diagram, project costs, build-out timeline
and milestones for project implementation, and a capital investment schedule evidencing
complete build-out and the initiation of service within four years of the date on which the entity
receives the subgrant, all certified by a professional engineer, stating that the proposed network
can deliver broadband service that meets the requisite performance requirements to all locations
served by the Project. An Eligible Entity shall not approve any grant for the deployment or
upgrading of network facilities unless it determines that the materials submitted to it demonstrate
the prospective subgrantee’s technical capability with respect to the proposed project.

**d.** **Compliance With Laws**

Each prospective subgrantee must demonstrate that it is capable of carrying out funded activities
in a competent manner in compliance with all applicable Federal, State, Territorial, and local
laws. To ensure that a subgrantee complies with occupational safety and health requirements,
subgrantees must permit workers to create worker-led health and safety committees that
management will meet with upon reasonable request.

**e.** **Operational Capability**

Prospective subgrantees must certify that they possess the operational capability to qualify to
complete and operate the Project. A prospective subgrantee that has provided a voice, broadband,
and/or electric transmission or distribution service for at least the two (2) consecutive years prior
to the date of its application submission or that it is a wholly owned subsidiary of such an entity,
must submit a certification that attests to these facts and specifies the number of years the
prospective subgrantee or its parent company has been operating.

If the prospective subgrantee has provided a voice and/or broadband service it must certify that it
has timely filed Commission Form 477s and the Broadband DATA Act submission, if
applicable, as required during this time period, and otherwise has complied with the
Commission’s rules and regulations. Alternatively, a prospective subgrantee should explain any

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 74

pending or completed enforcement action, civil litigation, or other matter in which it failed to
comply or was alleged to have failed to comply with Commission rules or regulations.

If the prospective subgrantee has operated only an electric transmission or distribution service, it
must submit qualified operating or financial reports that it has filed with the relevant financial
institution for the relevant time period along with a certification that the submission is a true and
accurate copy of the reports that were provided to the relevant financial institution. [94]

For a new entrant to the broadband market, a prospective subgrantee must provide evidence
sufficient to demonstrate that the newly formed entity has obtained, through internal or external
resources, sufficient operational capabilities. Such evidence may include resumes from key
personnel, project descriptions and narratives from contractors, subcontractors, or other partners
with relevant operational experience, or other comparable evidence.

An Eligible Entity shall not approve any grant for the deployment or upgrading of network
facilities unless it determines that the documents submitted to it demonstrate the prospective
subgrantee’s operational capability with respect to the proposed project.

**f.** **Ownership**

Eligible Entities shall require each prospective subgrantee to provide ownership information
consistent with the requirements set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 1.2112(a)(1)-(7).

**g.** **Other Public Funding**

Eligible Entities shall require each prospective subgrantee to disclose, for itself and for its
affiliates, [95] any application the subgrantee or its affiliates have submitted or plan to submit, and
every broadband deployment project that the subgrantee or its affiliates are undertaking or have
committed to undertake at the time of the application using public funds, including but not
limited to funds provided under: the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 116127; 134 Stat. 178); the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136; 134 Stat. 281), the Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2021 (Public Law 116-260; 134 Stat. 1182); or the American Rescue Plan of
2021 (Public Law 117-2; 135 Stat. 4), any federal Universal Service Fund high-cost program
( *e.g.*, RDOF, CAF), or any Eligible Entity or local universal service or broadband deployment
funding program. At a minimum, the Eligible Entity shall require the disclosure, for each
broadband deployment project, of: (a) the speed and latency of the broadband service to be
provided (as measured and/or reported under the applicable rules), (b) the geographic area to be

94 Acceptable submissions for this purpose will be the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) Form 7, Financial
and Operating Report Electric Distribution; the RUS Form 12, Financial and Operating Report Electric
Power Supply; the National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (CFC) Form 7, Financial
and Statistical Report; the CFC Form 12, Operating Report; or the CoBank Form 7; or the functional
replacement of one of these reports. *See* *Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Order*, 35 FCC Rcd at 719, n.
202.

95 The term “affiliate” shall be defined consistent with 47 U.S.C. § 153(2) (“The term ‘affiliate’ means a
person that (directly or indirectly) owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common
ownership or control with, another person. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “own” means to own
an equity interest (or the equivalent thereof) of more than 10 percent.”).

covered, (c) the number of unserved and underserved locations committed to serve (or, if the
commitment is to serve a percentage of locations within the specified geographic area, the
relevant percentage), [96] (d) the amount of public funding to be used, (e) the cost of service to the
consumer, and (f) the matching commitment, if any, provided by the subgrantee or its affiliates.

**V.** **Application and Submission Information**

This Section sets out information regarding how Eligible Entities may apply for and use BEAD
Program funding, including a link to the online application portal, formatting instructions,
certification requirements, submission timelines, and eligible uses for funding. It also provides
information regarding certifications that prospective subgrantees must make in order to be
eligible for subgrants.

**1.** **Instructions for Primary Tier Participant Certification:**

1. By signing and submitting this proposal, the prospective primary tier participant is
providing the certification set out below and agrees to comply with the requirements of 2
C.F.R. Parts 180, 1200 and 1326.
2. The inability of a person to provide the certification required below will not necessarily
result in denial of participation in this covered transaction. The prospective primary tier
participant shall submit an explanation of why it cannot provide the certification set out
below. The certification or explanation will be considered in connection with the
department or agency’s determination whether to enter into this transaction. However,
failure of the prospective primary tier participant to furnish a certification or an
explanation shall disqualify such person from participation in this transaction.
3. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance
was placed when the department or agency determined to enter into this transaction. If it
is later determined that the prospective primary tier participant knowingly rendered an
erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the federal government,
the department or agency may terminate this transaction for cause or default or may
pursue suspension or debarment.
4. The prospective primary tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the
department or agency to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective
primary tier participant learns its certification was erroneous when submitted or has
become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
5. The terms *covered transaction, civil judgment, debarment, suspension, ineligible,*
*participant, person, principal, and voluntarily excluded,* as used in this clause, are
defined in 2 C.F.R. Parts 180, 1200 and 1326. You may contact the department or agency
to which this proposal is being submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those
regulations.
6. The prospective primary tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should
the proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any
lower tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48
C.F.R. Part 9, Subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily
excluded from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the
department or agency entering into this transaction.
7. The prospective primary tier participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it
will include the clause titled “Instructions for Lower Tier Participant Certification”
including the “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
Voluntary Exclusion-Lower Tier Covered Transaction,” provided by the department or
agency entering into this covered transaction, without modification, in all lower tier
covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions and will
require lower tier participants to comply with 2 C.F.R. Parts 180, 1200 and 1326.
8. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a prospective
participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed for debarment under
48 C.F.R. Part 9, Subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded
from the covered transaction, unless it knows that the certification is erroneous. A
participant is responsible for ensuring that its principals are not suspended, debarred, or
otherwise ineligible to participate in covered transactions. To verify the eligibility of its
principals, as well as the eligibility of any prospective lower tier participants, each

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 77

participant may, but is not required to, check the System for Award Management
Exclusions website [(https://www.sam.gov/](https://www.sam.gov/) ) *.*
9. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a
system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by this clause.
The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to exceed that which is
normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
10. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 6 of these instructions, if a participant
in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered transaction with a
person who is proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R. Part 9, Subpart 9.4, suspended,
debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participation in this transaction, in
addition to other remedies available to the federal government, the department or agency
may terminate the transaction for cause or default.

**2.** **Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, and Other**
**Responsibility Matters - Primary Tier Covered Transactions:**

1. The prospective primary tier participant certifies to the best of its knowledge and belief,
that it and its principals:

a. Are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, declared
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participating in covered transactions by
any federal department or agency;

i. Have not within a three-year period preceding this proposal been
convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for
commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining,
attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, Eligible Entity, or
local) transaction or contract under a public transaction; violation of
federal or Eligible Entity antitrust statutes or commission of
embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of
records, making false statements, or receiving stolen property;
ii. Are not presently indicted for or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by
a governmental entity (federal, Eligible Entity or local) with commission
of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph 1.a.i of this certification;
and
iii. Have not within a three-year period preceding this application/proposal
had one or more public transactions (federal, Eligible Entity, or local)
terminated for cause or default.
2. Where the prospective primary tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements
in this certification, such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this
proposal.

**3.** **Instructions for Lower Tier Participant Certification (applies to**
**subgrantees):**

1. By submitting this proposal and accepting federal funding, the prospective lower tier
participant is providing the certification set out below and agrees to comply with the
requirements of 2 C.F.R. Parts 180, 1200 and 1326.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 78

2. The certification in this clause is a material representation of fact upon which reliance
was placed when this transaction was entered into. If it is later determined that the
prospective lower tier participant knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in
addition to other remedies available to the federal government, the department or agency
with which this transaction originated may pursue available remedies, including
suspension or debarment.
3. The prospective lower tier participant shall provide immediate written notice to the
person to which this proposal is submitted if at any time the prospective lower tier
participant learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become
erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
4. The terms *covered transaction, civil judgment, debarment, suspension, ineligible,*
*participant, person, principal, and voluntarily excluded,* as used in this clause, are
defined in 2 C.F.R. Parts 180, 1200 and 1326. You may contact the person to whom this
proposal is submitted for assistance in obtaining a copy of those regulations.
5. The prospective lower tier participant agrees by submitting this proposal that, should the
proposed covered transaction be entered into, it shall not knowingly enter into any lower
tier covered transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R.
Part 9, Subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended, declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded
from participation in this covered transaction, unless authorized by the department or
agency with which this transaction originated.
6. The prospective lower tier participant further agrees by submitting this proposal that it
will include the clause titled “Instructions for Lower Tier Participant Certification”
including the “Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and
Voluntary Exclusion- Lower Tier Covered Transaction,” without modification, in all
lower tier covered transactions and in all solicitations for lower tier covered transactions
and will require lower tier participants to comply with 2 C.F.R. Parts 180 and 1200.

a. A participant in a covered transaction may rely upon a certification of a
prospective participant in a lower tier covered transaction that it is not proposed
for debarment under 48 C.F.R. Part 9, Subpart 9.4, debarred, suspended,
ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from the covered transaction, unless it knows
that the certification is erroneous. A participant is responsible for ensuring that its
principals are not suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to participate in
covered transactions. To verify the eligibility of its principals, as well as the
eligibility of any prospective lower tier participants, each participant may, but is
not required to, check the System for Award Management Exclusions website
[(https://www.sam.gov](https://www.sam.gov/) ) *.*
b. Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of
a system of records in order to render in good faith the certification required by
this clause. The knowledge and information of a participant is not required to
exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary
course of business dealings.
c. Except for transactions authorized under paragraph 5 of these instructions, if a
participant in a covered transaction knowingly enters into a lower tier covered
transaction with a person who is proposed for debarment under 48 C.F.R. Part 9,
Subpart 9.4, suspended, debarred, ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from
participation in this transaction, in addition to other remedies available to the

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 79

federal government, the department or agency with which this transaction
originated may pursue available remedies, including suspension or debarment.

**4.** **Certification Regarding Debarment, Suspension, Ineligibility and**
**Voluntary Exclusion - Lower Tier Covered Transactions:**

1. The prospective lower tier participant certifies, by submission of this proposal, that
neither it nor its principals is presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment,
declared ineligible, or voluntarily excluded from participating in covered transactions by
any federal department or agency.
2. Where the prospective lower tier participant is unable to certify to any of the statements
in this certification, such prospective participant shall attach an explanation to this
proposal.

**E.** **Unique Entity Identifier and System for Award Management**

Pursuant to 2 C.F.R. Part 25, an applicant or recipient (as the case may be) is required to: (i) be
registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) before submitting its complete
application packet; (ii) provide a valid unique entity identifier in its application; and (iii)
continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current information at all times during
which it has an active federal award or an application or plan under consideration by a federal
awarding agency, unless otherwise excepted from these requirements pursuant to 2 C.F.R.
§ 25.110. NTIA will not make a federal award to an applicant until the applicant has complied
with all applicable unique entity identifier and SAM requirements and, if an applicant has not
fully complied with the requirements by the time that NTIA is ready to make a federal award
pursuant to this NOFO, NTIA may determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a
federal award.

**1.** **Unique Entity Identifier**

The U.S. government will use the unique entity identifier (UEI), found in an entity’s SAM.gov
registration, for federal awards management, including but not limited to, contracts, grants, and
cooperative agreements. The UEI is the primary key to identify an entity throughout the federal
awarding lifecycle and in SAM gov. Each Eligible Entity must obtain a UEI.
Each subrecipient must obtain a UEI and provide it to the Eligible Entity. Subrecipients are not
required to complete full SAM registration to obtain a UEI. 2 C.F.R. § 25.300.

The SAM-generated UEI (SAM) became the official identifier in April 2022.

For more information on the establishment of an entity’s UEI, please visit [http://www.sam.gov.](http://www.sam.gov/)

**2.** **System for Award Management**

Eligible Entities must register in the SAM before submitting any submissions through the
application portal. Additionally, the Eligible Entity must maintain an active SAM registration
with current information at all times during which it has an active federal award or an application
or plan under consideration by a federal awarding agency. Entities can register for the SAM at
[https://www.sam.gov/.](https://www.sam.gov/)

Initial Proposals will be due to NTIA no later than 180 days after issuance of their Notice of
Available Amounts.

Submissions submitted by postal mail, courier, email, facsimile, or other means aside from those
detailed herein will not be accepted. All application forms and documents must be included with
an applicant’s complete application packet submission via NTIA’s application portal.

When developing the submission timeline, each eligible applicant should keep in mind that: (1)
all applicants are required to have current registrations in the electronic System for Award
Management (SAM.gov) and the free annual registration process in SAM.gov generally takes
between three (3) and five (5) business days but can take more than three weeks. Please note that
a federal assistance award cannot be issued if the designated recipient’s registration in SAM.gov
is not current at the time of the award.

**G.** **Intergovernmental Review**

Applications from an Eligible Entity or a political subdivision of the Eligible Entity under this
Program are subject to Executive Order 12372, “Intergovernmental Review of Federal
Programs,” which requires intergovernmental consultation with State, Territorial, and local
officials. All applicants are required to submit a copy of their applications to their designated
Single Point of Contact (SPOC) offices. [97]

**H.** **Funding Restrictions**

**1.** **Eligible Uses of BEAD Program Funds**

Grant recipients may only use federal award funds and any non-federal cost share committed to
an award to pay for allowable costs under the BEAD Program. Allowable costs are determined in
accordance with the cost principles identified in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, including Subpart E of such
regulations for States and non-profit organizations, and in 48 C.F.R. Part 31 for commercial
organizations, [98] as well as in the grant program’s authorizing legislation. In addition, costs must

97 *See* 7 C.F.R. Part 3015, Subpart V.

98 The government has established a set of principles for determining eligible or allowable costs.
Allowable costs are determined in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity incurring
the costs. For example, the allowability of costs incurred by State, Territorial, local or Federally

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 81

be reasonable, necessary, allocable, and allowable for the proposed project or other eligible
activity and conform to generally accepted accounting principles. Funds committed to an award
may only be used to cover allowable costs incurred during the period of performance, except for
reasonable pre-award expenses as described above, and for allowable closeout costs incurred
during the grant closeout process.

**2.** **Ineligible Costs**

Ineligible costs include those costs that are unallowable under the applicable federal cost
principles. Please note that costs ineligible for the BEAD Program may not be paid for with
matching funds committed to an award. If an Eligible Entity is found to have used grant or
matching funds on a prohibited cost, the Assistant Secretary may take remedial action, including
but not limited to deobligation or clawback of funding.

In addition, grant funds awarded to an Eligible Entity under this program shall be used to
supplement, and not supplant, the amounts that the Eligible Entity would otherwise make
available for the purposes for which the grant funds may be used.

The following costs are specifically identified as prohibited under the BEAD Program:

**a.** **Prohibition On Use of Grant Funds for Covered**

**Communications Equipment or Services under the Secure and**
**Trusted Communications Networks Act**

An Eligible Entity or subgrantee (including contractors and subcontractors of subgrantees) may
not use grant funds received under the BEAD Program to purchase or support any covered
communications equipment or service (as defined in Section 9 of the Secure and Trusted
Communications Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. § 1608)).

**b.** **Prohibition on Profit and Fees**

A profit, fee, or other incremental charge above actual cost incurred by an Eligible Entity or
subgrantee is not an allowable cost under this Program.

**c.** **Prohibition on Use of Grant Funds to Support or Oppose**
**Collective Bargaining**

An Eligible Entity or a subgrantee may not use grant funds, whether directly or indirectly, to
support or oppose collective bargaining.

Recognized Indian Tribal Governments is determined in accordance with the provisions of 2 C.F.R. Part
200, Subpart E and the allowability of costs for commercial organizations is determined in accordance
with the provisions of 48 C.F.R. Part 31, unless the Grants Officer decides in writing to apply the cost
principles in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, Subpart E, to commercial organizations pursuant to 2 C.F.R. §
200.101(a)(2).

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 82

**3.** **Administrative Expenses**

An Eligible Entity may not use more than two percent of the grant amounts received under the
BEAD Program for expenses relating (directly or indirectly) to administration of the grant under
Section 60102(d)(2)(B) of the Infrastructure Act. NTIA will release further guidance on what
expenses qualify as “expenses relating (directly or indirectly) to administration of the grant”
subject to the statutory two percent limitation on these expenses.

**I.** **Material Representations and Public Disclosure of Applications**

All forms and supporting documents submitted as part of the Letter of Intent, Initial Proposal,
and Final Proposal will be treated as material representations of fact upon which NTIA will rely
in awarding grants. Applicants should acknowledge that NTIA may make all or portions of their
applications for grants under the BEAD Program publicly available consistent with applicable
federal law. See Section IX.B of this NOFO for additional information concerning the
confidentiality of information contained in an application.

**J.** **Other Submission Requirements**

Complete applications for the BEAD Program must be electronically submitted through
grants.ntia.gov. Late or incomplete applications and applications submitted by mail, courier, or
by facsimile will not be accepted.

**1.** **How to Register to Apply and Submit an Application**

Applicants should carefully follow specific instructions on the application site at
https://grants.ntia.gov/.

**2.** **Timely Receipt Requirements and Proof of Timely Submission**

Applicants should carefully follow specific instructions on the application site at
[https://grants.ntia.gov/](https://grants.ntia.gov/) to successfully submit an application or other required materials.
Applicants, specifically the Authorized Organization Representative submitting the application
and materials, will receive a time and date stamped email from the NTIA Grants Portal
confirming the submission and receipt of the application or other required documents, *e.g.*, Letter
of Intent, Initial Proposal, Final Proposal.

**3.** **Amendments**

Any amendments to this NOFO or additional Program guidance will be announced on NTIA.gov
and BroadbandUSA.NTIA.gov.

**VI.** **Application Review Information**

This Section briefly describes the review process that NTIA will undertake in assessing
submissions by Eligible Entities in connection with the BEAD Program.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 83

**A.** **Review Process for the BEAD Program**

Letters of Intent, Initial Planning Funds requests, Initial Proposals, and Final Proposals will be
evaluated by the Assistant Secretary to determine compliance with all necessary requirements
outlined in the Infrastructure Act, this NOFO, and additional regulations and/or guidance that
may be issued by NTIA.

After receipt of a completed Initial Proposal, the Assistant Secretary shall determine whether the
use of funds proposed in the Initial Proposal complies with applicable Program guidelines, is in
the public interest, and effectuates the purposes of the Infrastructure Act. Based on that
assessment, the Assistant Secretary will approve or disapprove the Initial Proposal. If the Initial
Proposal is approved, the Assistant Secretary will make at least 20 percent of the total allocation
available to the Eligible Entity. If the Initial Proposal is incomplete or is disapproved, the
Assistant Secretary shall notify the Eligible Entity and provide the Eligible Entity with an
opportunity to resubmit the Initial Proposal for consideration under the factors mentioned above.

After receipt of a completed Final Proposal, the Assistant Secretary shall determine whether the
use of funds proposed in the Final Proposal complies with applicable Program guidelines, is in
the public interest, and effectuates the purposes of the Infrastructure Act. Based on that
assessment, the Assistant Secretary will approve or disapprove the Final Proposal. If the Final
Proposal is approved, the Assistant Secretary will make the remainder of the grant funds
allocated available to the Eligible Entity. If the Final Proposal is incomplete or is disapproved the
Assistant Secretary shall notify the Eligible Entity and provide the Eligible Entity with an
opportunity to resubmit the Final Proposal for consideration under the factors mentioned above.
If an Eligible Entity fails to meet any applicable deadline and has not secured an extension from
the Assistant Secretary before the applicable deadline, a political subdivision or consortium of
political subdivisions of the Eligible Entity may submit the applicable type of covered
application in place of the Eligible Entity.

Eligible Entities are encouraged to maintain an ongoing dialogue with NTIA throughout proposal
development as a part of the technical assistance process. This partnership allows Eligible
Entities to receive interim feedback and ensure alignment of Eligible Entity and federal
priorities.

**B.** **Federal Awarding Agency Review of Risk Posed by Applicants**

After applications are proposed for funding by the Selecting Official for the BEAD Program
(specifically, the Assistant Secretary or the Assistant Secretary’s designee), the NIST Grants
Management Division (GMD) will perform pre-award risk assessments in accordance with 2
C.F.R. § 200.206. Such assessments may include review of the financial stability of an applicant
( *i.e.*, an Eligible Entity), the quality of the applicant’s management systems, the history of
performance, reports and findings from audits, and/or the applicant’s ability to effectively
implement statutory, regulatory, or other requirements imposed on non-federal entities. In
addition, prior to making an award where the total federal share is expected to exceed the
simplified acquisition threshold (currently $250,000), NIST GMD will review and consider the
non-publicly available information about that applicant in the Federal Awardee Performance and
Integrity Information System (FAPIIS). Upon completion of the pre-award risk assessment,

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 84

NIST GMD will determine whether the applicant is qualified to receive the award and, if so,
whether appropriate specific award conditions that correspond to the degree of risk posed by the
applicant should be applied to the award.

**C.** **Anticipated Announcement and Award Dates**

NTIA will review Letters of Intent, requests for Initial Planning Funds, Initial Proposals, and
Final Proposals on a rolling basis. Additional timeline details will be provided to Eligible
Entities once the Commission’s Broadband DATA Maps have been released and allocations
have been calculated.

**VII.** **Federal Award Administration Information**

This Section explains the process NTIA will employ to approve applications, notify successful
and unsuccessful applicants of the process’s results, and various legal obligations applicable to
grant recipients (including, but not limited to, those relating to domestic procurement preferences
(“Buy American” requirements) and contracting with small and minority businesses, women’s
business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms).

**A.** **Federal Award Notices**

The Assistant Secretary, or the Assistant Secretary’s designee, will submit the applications
recommended for funding, along with the bases for the recommendation, to the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) Grants Officer, who serves as the Grants Officer for the
BEAD program. The final approval of selected applications and the issuance of awards will be
made by the NIST Grants Officer. The award decisions of the NIST Grants Officer are final.

An applicant will be notified in writing by the NIST Grants Officer if its application is selected
for an award. If the application is selected for funding, the NIST Grants Officer will issue the
grant award (Form CD-450), which is the authorizing financial assistance award document. By
signing the Form CD-450, the recipient agrees to comply with all award provisions, terms, and
conditions.

If an applicant is awarded funding, neither NTIA nor NIST is under any obligation to provide
any additional future funding in connection with that award or to make any future award(s).
Amendment of an award to extend the period of performance is at the discretion of NTIA and the
NIST Grants Officer.

**B.** **Notification to Unsuccessful Applications.**

As detailed in Section VI.A of this NOFO, Eligible Entities will be notified if either the Initial
Proposal or Final Proposal is not approved by the Assistant Secretary and given a chance to
resubmit the proposal.

**C.** **Retention of Unsuccessful Applications.**

Unsuccessful applications will be retained in accordance with NTIA recordkeeping
requirements.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 85

**D.** **Administrative and National Policy Requirements**

Grant recipients will comply with applicable statutes and regulations, including but not limited

to:

**1.** **Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles and Audit**
**Requirements.**

Through 2 C.F.R. § 1327.101, the Department of Commerce adopted Uniform Administrative
Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards at 2 C.F.R. Part 200,
which apply to awards in this Program. Refer to [http://go.usa.gov/SBYh](http://go.usa.gov/SBYh) and

Contact(s)) if you need more information.

**4.** **Environmental and National Historical Preservation Requirements.**

Awarding agencies are required to analyze the potential environmental impacts, as required by
the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. § 4321 *et seq* .) and the National
Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (54 U.S.C. § 300101 *et seq* .) for Eligible Entity proposals and
awardee projects and other eligible activities seeking funding under the BEAD Program. Eligible
Entities with projects or other eligible activities containing construction and/or ground-disturbing
activities are required to submit all required environmental documentation to NTIA with their
Final Proposals, which also must describe how they will comply with applicable environmental
and national historical preservation requirements. It is the Eligible Entity’s and subgrantee’s
responsibility to obtain all necessary federal, Eligible Entity, and local governmental permits and
approvals necessary for the proposed work to be conducted. Projects and other eligible activities
are expected to be designed so that they minimize the potential for adverse impacts on the
environment. Eligible Entities also will be required to cooperate with NTIA in identifying
feasible measures to reduce or avoid any identified adverse environmental impacts of their
proposed projects or other eligible activities. The failure to do so may be grounds for not making
an award. Proposals will be reviewed to ensure that they contain sufficient information to allow
agency staff to conduct a NEPA analysis so that appropriate NEPA documentation can be

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 86

submitted to NTIA, along with the recommendation for funding of the selected projects or other
eligible activities. If additional information is required after an application is accepted for
funding, funds can be withheld by NTIA under a specific award condition requiring the awardee
to submit additional environmental compliance information sufficient for the agency to make an
assessment of any impacts that a project or other eligible activity may have on the environment.

**5.** **Property Trust Relationship and Public Notice Filings for Grant-**
**Acquired Property.**

In accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.316, any ~~real~~ ~~property~~, ~~equipment~~, ~~or~~ ~~intangible~~ ~~property~~

NTIA will provide information regarding the useful life schedules associated with assets
acquired with grant funds.

**6.** **Domestic Preference for Procurements (Buy American).**

The Infrastructure Act presents an important opportunity to ensure that American taxpayer
dollars are spent procuring needed products and supplies from American workers and businesses,
strengthening and growing U.S. domestic manufacturing capacity. Accordingly, all funds made
available through the BEAD Program for broadband infrastructure must comply with the Build
America, Buy America Act. [99] The Build America, Buy America Act requires that all of the iron,
steel, manufactured products (including but not limited to fiber-optic communications facilities),
and construction materials used in the project or other eligible activities are produced in the
United States unless a waiver is granted. Under the Build America, Buy America Act and the
Buy America Guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget on April 18, 2022, [100]
the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) may waive the application of this preference when (1)
applying the domestic content procurement preference would be inconsistent with the public
interest; (2) types of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials are not
produced in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a satisfactory

99 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, Division G, Public Law 117-58, 135 Stat. 429
(November 15, 2021).

2022), *available at* https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp - [content/uploads/2022/04/M](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/M-22-11.pdf) - 22 - 11.pdf (Buy America
Guidance).

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 87

quality; or (3) the inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or construction materials
produced in the United States will increase the cost of the overall project or other eligible
activities by more than 25 percent. Consistent with the waiver principles detailed in Sec.
70921(b)(1) of the Build America, Buy America Act and the Buy America Guidance, the
Secretary will seek to minimize waivers, and any waivers will be limited in duration and scope.

In determining whether a product is produced in America, subgrantees must comply with
definitions included in Section 70912 of the Build America, Buy America Act, which provides
that a manufactured product is considered produced in the United States if the manufactured
product was manufactured in the United States and the cost of the components of the
manufactured product that are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States is greater
than 55 percent of the total cost of all components of the manufactured product, unless another
standard for determining the minimum amount of domestic content of the manufactured product
has been established under applicable law or regulation.

In addition to the provisions above, subgrantees may not use BEAD funding to purchase or
support any covered communications equipment or service, as defined in Section 9 of the Secure
and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. § 1608).

Additionally, the Infrastructure Act expressly prohibits subgrantees from using BEAD funding to
purchase or support fiber optic cable and optical transmission equipment manufactured in the
People’s Republic of China unless a waiver of this requirement is received from the Assistant
Secretary. Waivers of the ban on Chinese-made fiber will be based on a demonstration from the
Eligible Entity that application of this prohibition would unreasonably increase the cost of or
delay the project or other eligible activities. Waiver applicants will need to provide concrete
evidence of this circumstance and will be held to a high burden of proof. Waiver policy in this
case will be guided by the same principles set out in Section 70921(b)(1) of the Build America,
Buy America Act, meaning that the Assistant Secretary will be disposed against waivers. In
addition, NTIA will consider any national security issues particular to Chinese-made fiber, and
even where domestic production is not feasible, will be reluctant to waive the ban if another
foreign supplier could meet the need at similar cost.

**7.** **Contracting with Small and Minority Businesses, Women's Business**
**Enterprises, and Labor Surplus Area Firms**

Minority Businesses Enterprises (MBEs) and Women’s Business Enterprises (WBEs) are major
catalysts for economic growth and job creation. However, data shows that MBEs and WBEs
historically face significant contracting disparities compared to other businesses. Pursuant to 2
C.F.R. § 200.321, Eligible Entities must take all necessary affirmative steps to assure that
minority businesses, women's business enterprises, and labor surplus area firms are used when
possible. Affirmative steps must include:

1. Placing qualified small and minority businesses and women's business enterprises on
solicitation lists;
2. Assuring that small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises are
solicited whenever they are potential sources;

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 88

3. Dividing total requirements, when economically feasible, into smaller tasks or quantities
to permit maximum participation by small and minority businesses, and women's
business enterprises;
4. Establishing delivery schedules, where the requirement permits, which encourage
participation by small and minority businesses, and women's business enterprises;
5. Using the services and assistance, as appropriate, of such organizations as the Small
Business Administration and the Minority Business Development Agency of the
Department of Commerce; and
6. Requiring subgrantees to take the affirmative steps listed above as it relates to its
subcontractors.

Eligible Entities are strongly encouraged to establish MBE and WBE utilization plans consistent
with their Initial and Final Proposals.

**E.** **Reporting**

Both Eligible Entities and subgrantees will be required to comply with reporting requirements. In
addition to the reporting requirements found in 2 C.F.R. Part 200, NTIA will provide additional
reporting instructions in connection with the requirements set forth in this Section, including
details on the manner and format that Eligible Entities will be required to report information in
support of federal agency obligations under the ACCESS BROADBAND Act, 47 USC § 1307,
and Infrastructure Act § 60105. [101]

**1.** **Reporting Requirements - Eligible Entities**

Not later than 90 days after receiving any Program grant funds, for the sole purposes of
providing transparency and providing information to inform future federal broadband planning,
an Eligible Entity shall submit to the Assistant Secretary an **initial report** that (i) describes the
planned and actual use of funds; (ii) describes the planned and actual subgrant process; (iii)
identifies the establishment of appropriate mechanisms by the Eligible Entity to ensure that all
subgrantees of the Eligible Entity comply with the eligible uses prescribed under the BEAD
Program and (iv) includes any other information required by the Assistant Secretary.

Not later than 1 year after receiving grant funds under this Section, and semiannually thereafter
until the funds have been expended, an Eligible Entity shall submit to the Assistant Secretary a
**semiannual report**, with respect to the 6-month period immediately preceding the report date,
that tracks the progress the Eligible Entity is making against its approved plans. Any such report
should include, at a minimum, the following information: (i) a description of how the Eligible
Entity expended the grant funds; (ii) a description of each service provided with the grant funds
and the status of projects or other eligible activities supported by such funds; (iii) a description of
the locations at which broadband service was made or will be made available using the grant
funds, the locations at which broadband service was utilized, and the comparative demographics
of those served; and (iv) a certification that the Eligible Entity complied with the requirements of
this Section and with any additional reporting requirements prescribed by the Assistant

**IX.** **Other Information**

This Section details information regarding topics including audit and reporting requirements,
mandatory transparency, accountability, and oversight measures, and consequences associated
with the unauthorized use of BEAD Program funds.

**A.** **Transparency**

The Infrastructure Act contains robust reporting requirements for Eligible Entities and
subgrantees, and requires NTIA, the Commission, and other agencies to coordinate to make
information regarding federal broadband funding, low-cost plans, and other aspects of the BEAD
Program readily available to and understandable by the public. NTIA will fulfill its obligations to
the fullest extent possible. Recipients of U.S. Department of Commerce and NTIA grants also
should be cognizant of the access to records requirements set forth at 2 C.F.R. § 200.337.

**B.** **Protected and Proprietary Information**

Eligible Entities and subgrantees acknowledge and understand that information and data
contained in applications for financial assistance, as well as information and data contained in
financial, performance, and other reports submitted by either entity, may be used by the
Department of Commerce in conducting reviews and evaluations of its financial assistance
programs and for statistical purposes. For this purpose, information and data may be accessed,
reviewed, and evaluated by Department of Commerce employees, other federal employees,
federal agents and contractors, and/or by non-federal personnel, all of whom enter into
appropriate confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements covering the use of such information.
As may be provided in the terms and conditions of a specific financial assistance award, Eligible
Entities and subgrantees are expected to support Program reviews and evaluations by submitting
required financial and performance information and data in an accurate and timely manner, and

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 94

by cooperation with the Department of Commerce and external program evaluators. In
accordance with 2 C.F.R. § 200.303(e), Eligible Entities and subgrantees are reminded that they
must take reasonable measures to safeguard protected personally identifiable information and
other confidential or sensitive personal or business information created or obtained in connection
with a Department of Commerce financial assistance award.

NTIA will protect confidential and proprietary information from public disclosure consistent
with applicable law, including the Trade Secrets Act, as amended (18 U.S.C. 1905) and the
Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (18 U.S.C. 1831 *et seq* .). In the event that a submission
contains information or data deemed to be confidential commercial information or that otherwise
should not be publicly disclosed, that information should be identified, bracketed, and marked as
Privileged, Confidential, Commercial or Financial Information. Based on these markings, the
confidentiality of the contents of those pages will be reviewed for protection consistent with
applicable law.

Additionally, some of the information submitted in the course of applying for funding under this
Program, or provided in the course of its grant management activities, may be considered law
enforcement sensitive or otherwise important to national security interests. This may include
threat, risk, and needs assessment information, and discussions of demographics, transportation,
public works, and industrial and public health infrastructures. In the event that a submission
contains such information or data, that information should be identified, bracketed, and marked
appropriately. Based on these markings, the confidentiality of the contents of those pages will be
reviewed for protection consistent with applicable law. The Eligible Entity and subgrantee
should be familiar with the regulations governing Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (6
C.F.R. Part 29) and Sensitive Security Information (49 C.F.R. Part 1520), as these designations
may provide additional protection to certain classes of homeland security information.

In addition to the public disclosure requirements of this program, the Eligible Entity is
encouraged to consult its own laws and regulations regarding the release of information, which
should be considered when reporting sensitive matters in the grant application. The Eligible
Entity may consult with NTIA regarding concerns or questions about the release of information
or how omitting sensitive information could impact NTIA’s assessment of the Eligible Entity’s
application.

**C.** **Funding Availability and Limitation of Liability**

Funding for the Program is contingent upon the continued availability of appropriations.
Publication of this NOFO does not oblige NTIA, NIST or the Department of Commerce to award
any specific project or other eligible activity or to obligate any available funds. NTIA will
recommend for funding only projects and other eligible activities that are deemed likely to
achieve the BEAD Program goals and for which funds are available.

**D.** **Third Party Beneficiaries**

The BEAD Program is not intended to and does not create any rights enforceable by third party
beneficiaries.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 95

**E.** **Waiver Authority**

It is the general intent of NTIA not to waive any of the provisions set forth in this NOFO.
However, at the discretion of the Assistant Secretary, NTIA, upon its own initiative or when
requested, may waive the provisions in this NOFO. Waivers may only be granted for
requirements that are discretionary and not mandated by statute or other applicable law. Any
request for a waiver must set forth the circumstances for the request.

**F.** **Paperwork Reduction Act and Administrative Procedures Act**

Section 60102(o) specifically exempts the BEAD Program from the requirements of the
Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. § 3506) and the Administrative Procedures Act.

**G.** **Transparency, Accountability, And Oversight Required**

**1.** **Generally**

NTIA, Eligible Entities, and subgrantees each have a critical role to play in ensuring that the
BEAD Program is implemented in a manner that ensures transparency, accountability, and
oversight sufficient to, among other things:

1. Minimize the opportunity for waste, fraud, and abuse;

2. Ensure that recipients of grants under the Program use grant funds to further the overall
purpose of the Program in compliance with the requirements of the Infrastructure Act,
this NOFO, 2 C.F.R. Part 200, the terms and conditions of the award, and other
applicable law; and

3. Allow the public to understand and monitor grants and subgrants awarded under the
Program.

To that end, NTIA and Eligible Entities shall:

1. Conduct such audits of grantees and subgrantees as are necessary and appropriate,
including audit requirements described in Section VII.G. Eligible Entities shall report the
full results of any audits they conduct to the appropriate Federal Program Officer.

2. Develop monitoring plans, subject to the approval of the Assistant Secretary, which may
include site visits or desk reviews, technical assistance, and random sampling of
compliance requirements.

3. Impose specific conditions on grant awards designed to mitigate the risk of
nonperformance where appropriate.

Each Eligible Entity and/or subgrantee shall, as appropriate:

1. Comply with the reporting requirements set forth in Section I.E of this NOFO.

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 95

2. Comply with the obligations set forth in 2 C.F.R. Part 200 and the Department of
Commerce Financial Assistance Standard Terms and Conditions.

3. Establish and widely publicize telephone numbers and email addresses for the Eligible
Entity’s Office of Inspector General (or comparable entity) or subgrantees’ internal ethics
office (or comparable entity) for the purpose of reporting waste, fraud or abuse in the
Program. Eligible Entities and subgrantees shall produce copies of materials used for
such purpose upon request of the Federal Program Officer.

**2.** **U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General**

The U.S. Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) seeks to improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of the Department’s programs, including deterring and detecting
fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. The OIG accomplishes this mission primarily through
investigations, audits, and inspections of Department activities, including grants, cooperative
agreements, loans, and contracts.

**a.** **Disclosures**

Recipients of financial assistance originating from the U.S. Department of Commerce, including
NTIA, shall timely disclose, in writing, to the OIG and awarding agency, whenever, in
connection with the award, performance, or closeout of this grant or sub-award thereunder, the
recipient has credible evidence that a principal, employee, agent, or sub-recipient has committed:

1. A violation of federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or
gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code; or

2. A violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).

**b.** **Reporting**

The OIG maintains a hotline to receive allegations of fraud, waste, or abuse. To report such
allegations, please visit https://www.oig.doc.gov/Pages/Hotline.aspx. Upon request, the OIG will
take appropriate measures to protect the identity of any individual who reports misconduct, as
authorized by the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended. Reports to the OIG may also be
made anonymously.

**3.** **Whistleblower Protection**

Recipients, sub-recipients, and employees working on this grant award will be subject to the
whistleblower rights and remedies established under 41 U.S.C. § 4712.

An employee of a recipient or sub-recipient may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise
discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing information that the employee reasonably
believes is evidence of: gross mismanagement of a federal contract or award; a gross waste of
federal funds; an abuse of authority ( *i.e.*, an arbitrary and capricious exercise of authority that is
inconsistent with the mission of NTIA or the U.S. Department of Commerce or the successful

Notice of Funding Opportunity – 95

performance of a contract or grant awarded by NTIA or the Department) relating to a federal
contract or award; a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; or a violation of a
law, rule, or regulation related to a federal contract (including the competition for or negotiation
of a contract) or grant.

The recipient or sub-recipient shall inform its employees and contractors, in writing, in the
predominant language of the workforce or organization, of employee whistleblower rights and
protections under 41 U.S.C. § 4712, as described above and at
https://www.oig.doc.gov/Pages/Whistleblower-Protection-Program.aspx.

**4.** **Enforcement**

NTIA shall take enforcement action against Eligible Entities and, if necessary, subgrantees, and
Eligible Entities shall take enforcement action against subgrantees, as necessary and appropriate:

1. A subgrantee that fails to comply with any requirement under Section 60102 of the
Infrastructure Act or this NOFO shall be required to return up to the entire amount of the
subgrant to the Eligible Entity, at the discretion of the Eligible Entity or the Assistant
Secretary.

2. If a subgrantee fails to comply with the low-cost broadband service option requirement
set out in Section 60102(h)(4)(B) of the Infrastructure Act, the Assistant Secretary may
take corrective action, including recoupment of funds from the subgrantee.

3. NTIA and Eligible Entities may also enforce applicable rules and laws by imposing
penalties for nonperformance, failure to meet statutory obligations, or wasteful,
fraudulent, or abusive expenditure of grant funds. Such penalties include, but are not
limited to, imposition of additional award conditions, payment suspension, award
suspension, grant termination, de-obligation/clawback of funds, and debarment of
organizations and/or personnel.

**H.** **Unauthorized Use of Funds.**

To the extent that the Assistant Secretary or the Inspector General of the Commerce Department
determines that an Eligible Entity or subgrantee has expended grant funds received under the
BEAD Program in violation of the requirements set forth in Section 60102 of the Infrastructure
Act, 2 C.F.R. Part 200, the terms and conditions of the award, or other applicable law, the
Assistant Secretary shall, if appropriate, recover the amount of funds that were so expended.
